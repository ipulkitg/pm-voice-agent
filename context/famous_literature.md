## Article 1: How to Develop Product Sense
**Source:** lennysnewsletter.com/p/product-sense  
**By:** Jules Walter (guest writer, PM at Slack and YouTube)  
**Published:** March 15, 2022

### Why This Article Matters
This is both a framework and a coaching guide. It gives the agent a method to help you learn product sense through concrete, actionable tactics like "Observe users," "Deconstruct great products," and "Learn from peers."

### Key Concepts

**What is Product Sense?**
Product sense is one of the most important PM skills but also the most vague and hardest to learn. The good news: it's NOT something you need to be born with—it's a learned skill like any other PM skill.

**Four Concrete Ways to Build Product Sense:**

#### 1. Use Great Products Regularly
- Don't just use products passively—actively observe and analyze them
- Ask yourself: Why did they make this design choice? What problem are they solving?
- Example: When using Cash App, notice how it prioritizes ease of use and breadth of capabilities beyond just peer-to-peer transfers

**Compare Products in the Same Category:**
- To understand a product deeply, compare it with others in the same space
- Example: Cash App vs. Venmo
  - Venmo's strategy: Lean into social graph (use Venmo because your friends are on it)
  - Cash App's strategy: Focus on ease of use and breadth of capabilities
  
**Dimensions to Compare:**
- Core user flows and how they differ
- Feature sets and what each emphasizes
- Design philosophy and trade-offs
- Target user base and positioning

#### 2. Deconstruct Products You Admire
- Break down why certain products work so well
- Study product decisions and the constraints that led to them
- Learn from both successes and failures

**Key Lesson from Stewart Butterfield (Slack):**
"If you remove lots of small annoyances that people deal with daily, the value adds up to something meaningful."

**Another Lesson:**
Spend time understanding user problems and framing them in a way that sets strong constraints for the team. Many PMs jump into solution-finding before they truly understand the problem, which leads to ineffective solutions or indecisiveness.

**Problem Framing Example:**
Two different framings of a problem lead to completely different solutions. The ability to reframe problems and set opinionated constraints is a key skill for product thinkers.

#### 3. Observe Users
- Watch how people actually use products
- Pay attention to their frustrations, workarounds, and delights
- User behavior often differs significantly from what you expect

#### 4. Learn from Peers and the PM Community
- Engage with other PMs to see how they think about problems
- Join PM communities and discussions
- Read case studies and post-mortems

### Signs You're Getting Better at Product Sense
- You can quickly identify why a product decision was made
- You anticipate user needs before they articulate them
- You can connect dots between disparate product features
- Your product intuition becomes more reliable over time

### Agent Coaching Application
When a user asks for product advice, the agent should:
1. Help them break down their product problem
2. Guide them to compare their solution with competitors
3. Encourage them to observe actual users
4. Suggest framing exercises to clarify constraints
5. Use examples from successful products to illustrate points

## Article 2: How to Differentiate Your Product
**Source:** lennysnewsletter.com/p/how-to-differentiate  
**Published:** January 11, 2022

### Why This Article Matters
Gives the agent 7 specific strategies to help answer the question: "How is my project different from what's already out there?" Critical for hackathons and competitive markets.

### The Importance of Differentiation

**Michael Porter's Insight:**
There are only TWO paths to winning a market:
1. **Operational effectiveness:** Performing activities better than rivals
2. **Differentiating:** Performing activities differently, or performing different activities, than rivals

**Why Differentiation Matters More:**
"Constant improvement in operational effectiveness is necessary to achieve superior profitability. However, it is not usually sufficient. Few companies have competed successfully on the basis of operational effectiveness over an extended period, and staying ahead of rivals gets harder every day. Competing to be unique is ultimately more sustainable than competing to be the best."

**The Problem with Operational Effectiveness Alone:**
- Your competition will learn from your success
- They'll copy you and eat away at your margins
- It becomes a race to the bottom
- If you run a different race, the competitive field becomes less crowded

**Examples:**
- Etsy came back to its roots after trying (and failing) to beat Amazon
- Airbnb (unique) and Booking.com (cheapest) can both co-exist
- Apple continues to stay high-end despite the huge low-end technology market

### The 7 Ways to Differentiate

#### 1. Be the Cheapest
- Offer the lowest price in your market
- Examples: ARCO (gas), Geico (insurance), Wish (e-commerce)
- **Advanced versions:**
  - Be completely free (Robinhood, Chime)
  - Make customers money (BlockFi, Compound)
- **Warning:** This is tough long-term because it's essentially operational effectiveness, which rarely lasts

#### 2. Be the Highest Quality
- Sell the premium, highest-quality product
- Examples: Apple, Gucci, Whole Foods, Tesla, MasterClass, Peloton
- When customers want a great experience, they know where to go
- **Tim Cook quote:** "We never had an objective to sell a low-cost phone. Our primary objective is to sell a great phone and provide a great experience."

#### 3. Be the Most Convenient
- Make it dramatically easier for customers
- Examples: Amazon (one-click), Uber (vs. taxis), DoorDash (vs. pickup)
- Remove friction at every step

#### 4. Be the Safest
- Prioritize trust, security, and safety
- Examples: Signal (messaging), Volvo (cars), certain financial products
- Important in markets where trust is a concern

#### 5. Sell a Proprietary Product
- Offer something no one else has
- Patents, exclusive content, unique technology
- Creates natural moat against competition

#### 6. Sell Something That Makes People Feel Great Buying
- Tap into emotional and identity aspects
- Examples: Patagonia (environmental values), TOMS (giving back), Tesla (innovation/status)
- Customers buy into the story and values, not just the product

#### 7. Focus on a Niche Underserved Market
- Serve a specific segment really well
- Examples: Etsy (handmade/unique items), Whole Foods originally (organic/quality groceries)
- Become the obvious choice for that segment

### Key Takeaway for Hackathons
**If you're having a hard time getting attention for your product, especially in a crowded market, pick ONE of these differentiators and go all-in.**

### Agent Coaching Application
When helping with differentiation:
1. Ask: "What are your competitive alternatives?"
2. Walk through each of the 7 differentiators
3. Help identify which one(s) align with the project's strengths
4. Remind: Going all-in on one is better than being mediocre on multiple
5. Check: Is this sustainable long-term?

## Article 3: Building Your Product Roadmap
**Sources:** 
- lennysnewsletter.com/p/mission-vision-strategy-goals-roadmap (Mission → Vision → Strategy → Goals → Roadmap → Task framework)
- lennysnewsletter.com/p/building-better-roadmaps-janna-bastow (Janna Bastow's Now/Next/Later framework)

### Why This Article Matters
When you're at a hackathon and ask, "What should we build next?", these frameworks give the agent a structure to help you create a simple, effective roadmap.

### Framework 1: Mission → Vision → Strategy → Goals → Roadmap → Task

This is the complete hierarchy for product planning:

**Mission** (Why you exist)
↓
**Vision** (What you want to become)
↓
**Strategy** (How you'll get there)
↓
**Goals** (Metrics that show progress)
↓
**Roadmap** (Features/projects to achieve goals)
↓
**Tasks** (Day-to-day work)

### The Roadmap Layer

**Why Goals Come Before Roadmap:**
When prioritizing the many ideas your team has, you look at ROI—effort vs. impact. The impact you're prioritizing against is based on how much you expect the project will impact your **goals**.

**Key Point:** You need goals before you align around a roadmap and prioritize tasks.

### Framework 2: Now/Next/Later Roadmap
**By:** Janna Bastow (Mind the Product, ProdPad)

#### The Problems with Traditional Timeline Roadmaps
- They become outdated quickly
- They create false precision and commitment
- They don't account for learning and iteration
- Teams get locked into dates rather than outcomes

#### The Now/Next/Later Alternative

**NOW:**
- What you're working on currently
- Clear, committed work in progress
- Has most detail and specificity

**NEXT:**
- What you're planning to work on soon
- Less detail, more flexibility
- Can shift based on learnings from NOW

**LATER:**
- Ideas and possibilities for the future
- Least detail, most flexible
- Acts as a backlog of validated ideas

#### Benefits of Now/Next/Later
- Focuses on strategy rather than dates
- Leaves room for experimentation and pivoting
- Easier to update and maintain
- Reduces pressure to commit to distant timelines
- Better for communicating intent vs. specific deliverables

#### How to Use It
1. Start with your vision and strategy
2. Identify the most important problems to solve
3. Bucket ideas into Now/Next/Later based on priority and certainty
4. Move things between buckets as you learn
5. Keep NOW focused and small
6. Use soft launches to learn before full rollout

### Practical Roadmap Tips

**From Linear's Approach:**
- Plan in detail for two quarters
- Sketch out the next half year
- Keep an extensive backlog to pull from
- Sequence projects based on optimal path (X supports Y, or specific people should tackle specific projects)

**Key Principle:**
Product goals should be about how you add value for existing customers or expand to a new customer base—in other words, how you solve customers' problems better.

### Agent Coaching Application
For roadmap questions:
1. Start with: "What's your goal/metric?"
2. Work backwards: What projects would move that metric?
3. Suggest Now/Next/Later structure for flexibility
4. Help prioritize based on impact vs. effort
5. Remind: Keep NOW small and focused
6. Encourage: Plan to learn, not just to ship

## Article 4: How to Prioritize Your Time (The LNO Framework)
**Source:** lennysnewsletter.com/p/episode-3-shreyas-doshi (Podcast with Shreyas Doshi)  
**Additional source:** coda.io/@shreyas/lno-framework  
**Featured in:** Lenny's Podcast, Episode #3  
**Date:** June 7, 2022

### Why This Article Matters
This is a meta-skill. It allows the agent to give you advice on how to manage your time and energy as a founder/engineer, which is perfect for a hackathon or any high-pressure product work.

### Shreyas Doshi's Background
- PM at Google, Twitter, Yahoo, and Stripe
- Joined Stripe as 4th PM, became first PM manager
- Grew Stripe's PM function from ~5 to 50+ people
- Known for tactical insights on product management

### The Problem: All Tasks Are NOT Created Equal

**Shreyas's Experience:**
"I spent my first three years as a relatively new Product Manager at Google feeling overwhelmed and stressed. Even as I was getting promoted, I didn't feel great about how I worked. This only changed when I realized that all tasks are not created equal."

### The LNO Framework

**LNO stands for:**
- **L = Leverage tasks**
- **N = Neutral tasks**
- **O = Overhead tasks**

#### Leverage Tasks (L)
- **Definition:** Tasks with 10x (or even 100x) return on effort
- **Examples:**
  - Writing a PRD for an important feature
  - Defining product strategy
  - Aligning two teams for greater impact
  - Creating your product roadmap
- **How to approach:** Give these your BEST effort and most focus time
- **Reality:** Very few tasks are actually L tasks (maybe 2-3 on your entire list)

#### Neutral Tasks (N)
- **Definition:** Tasks where effort results in roughly 1:1 return
- **Examples:**
  - Standard feature specs
  - Regular team meetings
  - Most project updates
- **How to approach:** Do them competently but don't over-invest
- **Goal:** Complete them efficiently at adequate quality

#### Overhead Tasks (O)
- **Definition:** Necessary tasks that provide less return than effort invested
- **Examples:**
  - Responding to most emails
  - Routine status reports that people barely read
  - Admin work that must be done
  - 24-month resourcing projections (if people just scan them anyway)
- **How to approach:** Do them quickly, minimize time spent
- **Key insight:** These are necessary but should get minimal energy

### How to Apply the LNO Framework

#### Step 1: Categorize Your Tasks
- Look at your to-do list
- Ask for each task: "How impactful will the result of this task be for my business?"
- Label each task as L, N, or O

#### Step 2: Redistribute Your Effort
- **Before LNO:** You probably treat all tasks equally
- **After LNO:** Intentionally allocate effort based on category
- **Important:** Time is finite, so you'll "steal" from O and N tasks to give to L tasks
- **Result:** You may actually save time overall

#### Step 3: Tactical Approach to L Tasks
**The "Placebo Productivity" Hack:**
- L tasks often trigger procrastination (they're intimidating!)
- Start with small N or O tasks first (email, easy stuff)
- This creates momentum and reduces anxiety
- Then tackle your L task with fresh energy

### Real-World Example Comparison

**24-Month Resourcing Projection:**
- **Surface level:** Seems important
- **Reality:** People often just scan these
- **LNO categorization:** O task
- **Approach:** Create it quickly, don't over-polish

**PRD for Product Strategy:**
- **Surface level:** Just another document
- **Reality:** Defines entire team direction
- **LNO categorization:** L task  
- **Approach:** Invest significant time, get it right

### ROI Thinking vs. Opportunity Cost Thinking

**The Traditional ROI Trap:**
- ROI thinking: "Is this a good use of my time?"
- Problem: Hundreds of things provide positive ROI
- Result: Your plate fills with low-hanging fruit and quick wins
- Outcome: You miss bigger opportunities

**The Better Approach: Minimize Opportunity Cost:**
- Ask instead: "Is this the BEST use of my time?"
- Learned from Patrick Collison, CEO of Stripe
- Subtle but profound shift in thinking
- Forces you to prioritize truly high-impact work

**In High-Leverage Roles:**
Stop doing work that simply provides positive ROI → Start focusing on work that minimizes opportunity cost

### Important Notes

**Context Matters:**
- What's an L, N, or O task varies by:
  - Your company/team
  - Your role
  - Current priorities
  - Company culture
- Example: If resourcing projections are taken very seriously at your company, bump them to N or L

**It's Not One-Time:**
- LNO is not a one-time fix
- Come back to these principles repeatedly
- Re-evaluate as context changes
- Stay disciplined about protecting time for L tasks

### Agent Coaching Application

When the user feels overwhelmed or asks about prioritization:
1. Introduce the LNO framework
2. Ask them to categorize their current tasks
3. Check: "Are you giving L tasks your best effort?"
4. Identify: "What O tasks are taking too much time?"
5. Suggest: "Use placebo productivity to start L tasks"
6. Reframe: "Is this the BEST use of your time?" (not just "good")
7. Remind: "Very few tasks are truly L tasks—that's okay"

When planning a hackathon project:
- Help identify which parts are L tasks (strategy, core features)
- Suggest N-level execution for most features
- Identify O tasks that can be skipped or minimized
- Prevent over-engineering on N and O tasks

## Summary: How to Use These Articles Together

### For Product Sense Development
Use Article 1 to help users learn by doing—observing, deconstructing, and comparing products.

### For Differentiation Strategy
Use Article 2 when users ask "What makes this different?" Guide them through the 7 differentiators.

### For Roadmap Planning  
Use Article 3 to structure what to build next with Now/Next/Later or Mission → Strategy → Goals → Roadmap.

### For Time Management
Use Article 4 to help users focus on high-leverage work and avoid burnout by categorizing tasks as L, N, or O.

### Combined Workflow Example

**User:** "I'm at a hackathon and need to build a product. What should I focus on?"

**Agent Response Pattern:**
1. **Differentiation (Article 2):** "Let's first figure out how you'll differentiate. Of the 7 ways to differentiate, which fits your idea? Are you going for cheapest, highest quality, most convenient, safest, proprietary, values-driven, or niche focus?"

2. **Roadmap (Article 3):** "Now let's break down your NOW/NEXT/LATER. For this hackathon, what's your NOW (what you build this weekend)? What stays in NEXT for after the hackathon?"

3. **Prioritization (Article 4):** "Let's use LNO to prioritize your tasks. What are your 1-2 LEVERAGE tasks—the ones that will make or break your demo? What's OVERHEAD that you can skip or do quickly?"

4. **Product Sense (Article 1):** "Have you looked at competitors? Let's deconstruct what they do well and differently. What can you learn from their product decisions?"

This gives the agent a complete framework to coach users from idea to execution, just like Lenny would.
