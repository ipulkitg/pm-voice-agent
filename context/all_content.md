## Article 1: How to Develop Product Sense
**Source:** lennysnewsletter.com/p/product-sense
**By:** Jules Walter (guest writer, PM at Slack and YouTube)
**Published:** March 15, 2022

### Why This Article Matters
This is both a framework and a coaching guide. It gives the agent a method to help you learn product sense through concrete, actionable tactics like "Observe users," "Deconstruct great products," and "Learn from peers."

### Key Concepts

**What is Product Sense?**
Product sense is one of the most important PM skills but also the most vague and hardest to learn. The good news: it's NOT something you need to be born with—it's a learned skill like any other PM skill.

**Four Concrete Ways to Build Product Sense:**

#### 1. Use Great Products Regularly
- Don't just use products passively—actively observe and analyze them
- Ask yourself: Why did they make this design choice? What problem are they solving?
- Example: When using Cash App, notice how it prioritizes ease of use and breadth of capabilities beyond just peer-to-peer transfers

**Compare Products in the Same Category:**
- To understand a product deeply, compare it with others in the same space
- Example: Cash App vs. Venmo
- Venmo's strategy: Lean into social graph (use Venmo because your friends are on it)
- Cash App's strategy: Focus on ease of use and breadth of capabilities

**Dimensions to Compare:**
- Core user flows and how they differ
- Feature sets and what each emphasizes
- Design philosophy and trade-offs
- Target user base and positioning

#### 2. Deconstruct Products You Admire
- Break down why certain products work so well
- Study product decisions and the constraints that led to them
- Learn from both successes and failures

**Key Lesson from Stewart Butterfield (Slack):**
"If you remove lots of small annoyances that people deal with daily, the value adds up to something meaningful."

**Another Lesson:**
Spend time understanding user problems and framing them in a way that sets strong constraints for the team. Many PMs jump into solution-finding before they truly understand the problem, which leads to ineffective solutions or indecisiveness.

**Problem Framing Example:**
Two different framings of a problem lead to completely different solutions. The ability to reframe problems and set opinionated constraints is a key skill for product thinkers.

#### 3. Observe Users
- Watch how people actually use products
- Pay attention to their frustrations, workarounds, and delights
- User behavior often differs significantly from what you expect

#### 4. Learn from Peers and the PM Community
- Engage with other PMs to see how they think about problems
- Join PM communities and discussions
- Read case studies and post-mortems

### Signs You're Getting Better at Product Sense
- You can quickly identify why a product decision was made
- You anticipate user needs before they articulate them
- You can connect dots between disparate product features
- Your product intuition becomes more reliable over time

### Agent Coaching Application
When a user asks for product advice, the agent should:
1. Help them break down their product problem
2. Guide them to compare their solution with competitors
3. Encourage them to observe actual users
4. Suggest framing exercises to clarify constraints
5. Use examples from successful products to illustrate points

## Article 2: How to Differentiate Your Product
**Source:** lennysnewsletter.com/p/how-to-differentiate
**Published:** January 11, 2022

### Why This Article Matters
Gives the agent 7 specific strategies to help answer the question: "How is my project different from what's already out there?" Critical for hackathons and competitive markets.

### The Importance of Differentiation

**Michael Porter's Insight:**
There are only TWO paths to winning a market:
1. **Operational effectiveness:** Performing activities better than rivals
2. **Differentiating:** Performing activities differently, or performing different activities, than rivals

**Why Differentiation Matters More:**
"Constant improvement in operational effectiveness is necessary to achieve superior profitability. However, it is not usually sufficient. Few companies have competed successfully on the basis of operational effectiveness over an extended period, and staying ahead of rivals gets harder every day. Competing to be unique is ultimately more sustainable than competing to be the best."

**The Problem with Operational Effectiveness Alone:**
- Your competition will learn from your success
- They'll copy you and eat away at your margins
- It becomes a race to the bottom
- If you run a different race, the competitive field becomes less crowded

**Examples:**
- Etsy came back to its roots after trying (and failing) to beat Amazon
- Airbnb (unique) and Booking.com (cheapest) can both co-exist
- Apple continues to stay high-end despite the huge low-end technology market

### The 7 Ways to Differentiate

#### 1. Be the Cheapest
- Offer the lowest price in your market
- Examples: ARCO (gas), Geico (insurance), Wish (e-commerce)
- **Advanced versions:**
- Be completely free (Robinhood, Chime)
- Make customers money (BlockFi, Compound)
- **Warning:** This is tough long-term because it's essentially operational effectiveness, which rarely lasts

#### 2. Be the Highest Quality
- Sell the premium, highest-quality product
- Examples: Apple, Gucci, Whole Foods, Tesla, MasterClass, Peloton
- When customers want a great experience, they know where to go
- **Tim Cook quote:** "We never had an objective to sell a low-cost phone. Our primary objective is to sell a great phone and provide a great experience."

#### 3. Be the Most Convenient
- Make it dramatically easier for customers
- Examples: Amazon (one-click), Uber (vs. taxis), DoorDash (vs. pickup)
- Remove friction at every step

#### 4. Be the Safest
- Prioritize trust, security, and safety
- Examples: Signal (messaging), Volvo (cars), certain financial products
- Important in markets where trust is a concern

#### 5. Sell a Proprietary Product
- Offer something no one else has
- Patents, exclusive content, unique technology
- Creates natural moat against competition

#### 6. Sell Something That Makes People Feel Great Buying
- Tap into emotional and identity aspects
- Examples: Patagonia (environmental values), TOMS (giving back), Tesla (innovation/status)
- Customers buy into the story and values, not just the product

#### 7. Focus on a Niche Underserved Market
- Serve a specific segment really well
- Examples: Etsy (handmade/unique items), Whole Foods originally (organic/quality groceries)
- Become the obvious choice for that segment

### Key Takeaway for Hackathons
**If you're having a hard time getting attention for your product, especially in a crowded market, pick ONE of these differentiators and go all-in.**

### Agent Coaching Application
When helping with differentiation:
1. Ask: "What are your competitive alternatives?"
2. Walk through each of the 7 differentiators
3. Help identify which one(s) align with the project's strengths
4. Remind: Going all-in on one is better than being mediocre on multiple
5. Check: Is this sustainable long-term?

## Article 3: Building Your Product Roadmap
**Sources:**
- lennysnewsletter.com/p/mission-vision-strategy-goals-roadmap (Mission → Vision → Strategy → Goals → Roadmap → Task framework)
- lennysnewsletter.com/p/building-better-roadmaps-janna-bastow (Janna Bastow's Now/Next/Later framework)

### Why This Article Matters
When you're at a hackathon and ask, "What should we build next?", these frameworks give the agent a structure to help you create a simple, effective roadmap.

### Framework 1: Mission → Vision → Strategy → Goals → Roadmap → Task

This is the complete hierarchy for product planning:

**Mission** (Why you exist)
↓
**Vision** (What you want to become)
↓
**Strategy** (How you'll get there)
↓
**Goals** (Metrics that show progress)
↓
**Roadmap** (Features/projects to achieve goals)
↓
**Tasks** (Day-to-day work)

### The Roadmap Layer

**Why Goals Come Before Roadmap:**
When prioritizing the many ideas your team has, you look at ROI—effort vs. impact. The impact you're prioritizing against is based on how much you expect the project will impact your **goals**.

**Key Point:** You need goals before you align around a roadmap and prioritize tasks.

### Framework 2: Now/Next/Later Roadmap
**By:** Janna Bastow (Mind the Product, ProdPad)

#### The Problems with Traditional Timeline Roadmaps
- They become outdated quickly
- They create false precision and commitment
- They don't account for learning and iteration
- Teams get locked into dates rather than outcomes

#### The Now/Next/Later Alternative

**NOW:**
- What you're working on currently
- Clear, committed work in progress
- Has most detail and specificity

**NEXT:**
- What you're planning to work on soon
- Less detail, more flexibility
- Can shift based on learnings from NOW

**LATER:**
- Ideas and possibilities for the future
- Least detail, most flexible
- Acts as a backlog of validated ideas

#### Benefits of Now/Next/Later
- Focuses on strategy rather than dates
- Leaves room for experimentation and pivoting
- Easier to update and maintain
- Reduces pressure to commit to distant timelines
- Better for communicating intent vs. specific deliverables

#### How to Use It
1. Start with your vision and strategy
2. Identify the most important problems to solve
3. Bucket ideas into Now/Next/Later based on priority and certainty
4. Move things between buckets as you learn
5. Keep NOW focused and small
6. Use soft launches to learn before full rollout

### Practical Roadmap Tips

**From Linear's Approach:**
- Plan in detail for two quarters
- Sketch out the next half year
- Keep an extensive backlog to pull from
- Sequence projects based on optimal path (X supports Y, or specific people should tackle specific projects)

**Key Principle:**
Product goals should be about how you add value for existing customers or expand to a new customer base—in other words, how you solve customers' problems better.

### Agent Coaching Application
For roadmap questions:
1. Start with: "What's your goal/metric?"
2. Work backwards: What projects would move that metric?
3. Suggest Now/Next/Later structure for flexibility
4. Help prioritize based on impact vs. effort
5. Remind: Keep NOW small and focused
6. Encourage: Plan to learn, not just to ship

## Article 4: How to Prioritize Your Time (The LNO Framework)
**Source:** lennysnewsletter.com/p/episode-3-shreyas-doshi (Podcast with Shreyas Doshi)
**Additional source:** coda.io/@shreyas/lno-framework
**Featured in:** Lenny's Podcast, Episode #3
**Date:** June 7, 2022

### Why This Article Matters
This is a meta-skill. It allows the agent to give you advice on how to manage your time and energy as a founder/engineer, which is perfect for a hackathon or any high-pressure product work.

### Shreyas Doshi's Background
- PM at Google, Twitter, Yahoo, and Stripe
- Joined Stripe as 4th PM, became first PM manager
- Grew Stripe's PM function from ~5 to 50+ people
- Known for tactical insights on product management

### The Problem: All Tasks Are NOT Created Equal

**Shreyas's Experience:**
"I spent my first three years as a relatively new Product Manager at Google feeling overwhelmed and stressed. Even as I was getting promoted, I didn't feel great about how I worked. This only changed when I realized that all tasks are not created equal."

### The LNO Framework

**LNO stands for:**
- **L = Leverage tasks**
- **N = Neutral tasks**
- **O = Overhead tasks**

#### Leverage Tasks (L)
- **Definition:** Tasks with 10x (or even 100x) return on effort
- **Examples:**
- Writing a PRD for an important feature
- Defining product strategy
- Aligning two teams for greater impact
- Creating your product roadmap
- **How to approach:** Give these your BEST effort and most focus time
- **Reality:** Very few tasks are actually L tasks (maybe 2-3 on your entire list)

#### Neutral Tasks (N)
- **Definition:** Tasks where effort results in roughly 1:1 return
- **Examples:**
- Standard feature specs
- Regular team meetings
- Most project updates
- **How to approach:** Do them competently but don't over-invest
- **Goal:** Complete them efficiently at adequate quality

#### Overhead Tasks (O)
- **Definition:** Necessary tasks that provide less return than effort invested
- **Examples:**
- Responding to most emails
- Routine status reports that people barely read
- Admin work that must be done
- 24-month resourcing projections (if people just scan them anyway)
- **How to approach:** Do them quickly, minimize time spent
- **Key insight:** These are necessary but should get minimal energy

### How to Apply the LNO Framework

#### Step 1: Categorize Your Tasks
- Look at your to-do list
- Ask for each task: "How impactful will the result of this task be for my business?"
- Label each task as L, N, or O

#### Step 2: Redistribute Your Effort
- **Before LNO:** You probably treat all tasks equally
- **After LNO:** Intentionally allocate effort based on category
- **Important:** Time is finite, so you'll "steal" from O and N tasks to give to L tasks
- **Result:** You may actually save time overall

#### Step 3: Tactical Approach to L Tasks
**The "Placebo Productivity" Hack:**
- L tasks often trigger procrastination (they're intimidating!)
- Start with small N or O tasks first (email, easy stuff)
- This creates momentum and reduces anxiety
- Then tackle your L task with fresh energy

### Real-World Example Comparison

**24-Month Resourcing Projection:**
- **Surface level:** Seems important
- **Reality:** People often just scan these
- **LNO categorization:** O task
- **Approach:** Create it quickly, don't over-polish

**PRD for Product Strategy:**
- **Surface level:** Just another document
- **Reality:** Defines entire team direction
- **LNO categorization:** L task
- **Approach:** Invest significant time, get it right

### ROI Thinking vs. Opportunity Cost Thinking

**The Traditional ROI Trap:**
- ROI thinking: "Is this a good use of my time?"
- Problem: Hundreds of things provide positive ROI
- Result: Your plate fills with low-hanging fruit and quick wins
- Outcome: You miss bigger opportunities

**The Better Approach: Minimize Opportunity Cost:**
- Ask instead: "Is this the BEST use of my time?"
- Learned from Patrick Collison, CEO of Stripe
- Subtle but profound shift in thinking
- Forces you to prioritize truly high-impact work

**In High-Leverage Roles:**
Stop doing work that simply provides positive ROI → Start focusing on work that minimizes opportunity cost

### Important Notes

**Context Matters:**
- What's an L, N, or O task varies by:
- Your company/team
- Your role
- Current priorities
- Company culture
- Example: If resourcing projections are taken very seriously at your company, bump them to N or L

**It's Not One-Time:**
- LNO is not a one-time fix
- Come back to these principles repeatedly
- Re-evaluate as context changes
- Stay disciplined about protecting time for L tasks

### Agent Coaching Application

When the user feels overwhelmed or asks about prioritization:
1. Introduce the LNO framework
2. Ask them to categorize their current tasks
3. Check: "Are you giving L tasks your best effort?"
4. Identify: "What O tasks are taking too much time?"
5. Suggest: "Use placebo productivity to start L tasks"
6. Reframe: "Is this the BEST use of your time?" (not just "good")
7. Remind: "Very few tasks are truly L tasks—that's okay"

When planning a hackathon project:
- Help identify which parts are L tasks (strategy, core features)
- Suggest N-level execution for most features
- Identify O tasks that can be skipped or minimized
- Prevent over-engineering on N and O tasks

## Summary: How to Use These Articles Together

### For Product Sense Development
Use Article 1 to help users learn by doing—observing, deconstructing, and comparing products.

### For Differentiation Strategy
Use Article 2 when users ask "What makes this different?" Guide them through the 7 differentiators.

### For Roadmap Planning
Use Article 3 to structure what to build next with Now/Next/Later or Mission → Strategy → Goals → Roadmap.

### For Time Management
Use Article 4 to help users focus on high-leverage work and avoid burnout by categorizing tasks as L, N, or O.

### Combined Workflow Example

**User:** "I'm at a hackathon and need to build a product. What should I focus on?"

**Agent Response Pattern:**
1. **Differentiation (Article 2):** "Let's first figure out how you'll differentiate. Of the 7 ways to differentiate, which fits your idea? Are you going for cheapest, highest quality, most convenient, safest, proprietary, values-driven, or niche focus?"

2. **Roadmap (Article 3):** "Now let's break down your NOW/NEXT/LATER. For this hackathon, what's your NOW (what you build this weekend)? What stays in NEXT for after the hackathon?"

3. **Prioritization (Article 4):** "Let's use LNO to prioritize your tasks. What are your 1-2 LEVERAGE tasks—the ones that will make or break your demo? What's OVERHEAD that you can skip or do quickly?"

4. **Product Sense (Article 1):** "Have you looked at competitors? Let's deconstruct what they do well and differently. What can you learn from their product decisions?"

This gives the agent a complete framework to coach users from idea to execution, just like Lenny would.

Having a lofty mission is good. But without clearly-defined team objectives and project goals to track toward, you’ll never achieve that mission.

Lenny Rachitsky, founder of Lenny’s Newsletter and Podcast (and former Product Lead at Airbnb), has interviewed hundreds of leaders, using that knowledge to build a framework that helps teams turn aspirational missions into strategic actions. It connects specific projects to the bigger picture of why this work is important.

In this post, we’ll walk through Lenny’s template, every key strategic input, and show you how you can use this template to build an actionable, inspiring team strategy.

## Clearly articulate your mission and vision, because they will shape your work

![Help shape your work with a clearly articulated team mission and vision.](https://www.notion.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fspoqsaf9291f%2F7FutzuTGHtDj63HE4NaMkk%2F205dfdb42c634d64a185fd6dcb23f2c0%2Flenny_template_mission_vision.png&w=3840&q=75)

Help shape your work with a clearly articulated team mission and vision.

Start with the biggest and most important ideas: your team mission and vision. Both should be super clear since they’ll directly impact the projects your team executes.

> Your mission describes what you’re trying to achieve in the world. Once you clearly define this, everything trickles down from here.

![](https://www.notion.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fspoqsaf9291f%2F92e892e3-61fb-4577-b19d-bbd9e9435575%2F0013fc77bfe035629f457303c19e649b%2F92e892e3-61fb-4577-b19d-bbd9e9435575.png&w=96&q=80)

Lenny Rachitsky

Founder, Lenny's Newsletter and Podcast

Your mission and vision have distinct purposes — your mission is what you’re trying to accomplish now, while your vision is what the world looks like once you’ve accomplished it.

Done well, your mission and vision will create buy-in across the team, leading to more inspired, focused strategic work.

But don’t stop after you’ve written your mission and vision here. They should be repeated often and included across all docs so they become more deeply ingrained in everyone’s work.

## Refine your team mission into an actionable strategy by focusing on the “what” and “why”

Once you’ve laid out the high-level mission and vision, this is an opportunity to dive deeper into the strategy.

"Your strategy is your plan to achieve your vision — it’s the specifics of what you’re going to do to win," says Lenny.

### Set your team’s guiding goal

With your strategy in mind, ask yourself — what success metric will allow me to track whether I’m making progress on my strategy (and thus, my mission)?

It’s crucial to have a metric that acts as your guiding goal. Lenny poses one question to help [identify your ideal north star metric](https://future.com/north-star-metrics/):

_Which metric, if it were to increase today, would most accelerate my business’s flywheel?_

This metric should be set, but revisit it quarterly to make sure your work is aligned and on-track.

![Set a clear goal and build out a strategy.](https://www.notion.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fspoqsaf9291f%2F3Gh45mr2MvTemdCBTKNpjF%2Ff21da6d783c87066fecd267618febf7b%2Flenny_template_goal_strategy.png&w=3840&q=75)

Set a clear goal and build out a strategy.

### Build a strategic framework

Once you have a metric to focus on, it’s time to define your team’s strategy to help you hit that target goal. Lay out a one or two paragraph narrative and why it’s the right approach.

Lenny breaks the strategy down into a simple framework: Situation, Complication, and Resolution.

- Situation: _What is the state of affairs today? What are the facts that everyone will agree with?_

- Complication: _What’s the problem that needs to be fixed?_

- Resolution: _What do you recommend we do to resolve this complication?_


Using a framework that focuses on the **what** and **why** behind the action is a good way to set the stage for the work that you take on. Here are some examples of well-articulated strategies (using various frameworks) from [Yahoo!](https://sriramk.com/memos/garlinghouse-peanut-butter.pdf), [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-deux), and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/company/strategy/).

For example, if you’ve set a team goal to increase customer retention by 15% over the next 6 months, your strategic framework might look something like this:

- **Situation**: High customer churn rate, leading to lower revenue and less repeat business.

- **Complication**: Customers are not finding the value they expect from our product, leading to a lack of engagement and ultimately churn.

- **Resolution:** By focusing on improving customer satisfaction and engagement, we believe we can increase customer retention and ultimately drive more revenue for the company.

## Provide deeper context to connect strategy and work

Now it’s time to decide what projects you’ll execute to make that strategy a reality.

Use your strategic framework to create **strategic pillars**. Think about these as the buckets of work needed to execute your strategy.

> A strategy isn’t worth much without specific actions you plan to take. Your strategic pillars are meant for you to go one level deeper and share what you actually plan to do to achieve this strategy.

![](https://www.notion.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fspoqsaf9291f%2F92e892e3-61fb-4577-b19d-bbd9e9435575%2F0013fc77bfe035629f457303c19e649b%2F92e892e3-61fb-4577-b19d-bbd9e9435575.png&w=96&q=80)

Lenny Rachitsky

Founder, Lenny's Newsletter and Podcast

Each pillar breaks down into four key sections:

- What are you going to do?

- Why is it important?

- What will success look like?

- What specific projects need to happen?


They each act as a mini project brief to help you define the details and provide deeper clarity into how the work helps the team achieve its goals. Identify the stakeholders that will own each pillar and bring in any cross-functional partners that you’ll need to work with too.

![Build each strategic pillar by defining the what, why, success metrics, and key initiatives.](https://www.notion.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fspoqsaf9291f%2FVHsDrepdNJi0q296dDG2X%2Fd778931186f8a805e40f5e9b1dccd978%2Flenny_template_strategic_pillar.png&w=3840&q=75)

Build each strategic pillar by defining the what, why, success metrics, and key initiatives.

“A common pitfall in strategic team planning is overestimating what you can do and what you need to do,” says Lenny. “Planning to do too many things can easily wind up creating more day-to-day work, but less impactful work.”

While there’s no magic number, Lenny points out that more strategic pillars doesn’t always equate to more work getting done. He suggests 3-5 pillars to make sure you’re balancing effort and impact.

Building on our customer churn example above, your strategic pillars might include understanding your customer needs and improving the onboarding process. These pillars would give you a few areas of work to maximize impact and help you hit your customer retention goal.

If you use OKRs, this is a good place to connect your projects with objectives to better track what’s happening (and the outcomes).

## A strategy aligned from top to bottom

The individual pieces of a team strategy often exist, but they usually live in disconnected docs. Connecting all the parts of your strategy — from mission to projects — helps the team stay on track and work in a more cohesive way.

Lenny’s template does exactly that. It gives you a space to create a thread between the company, your team, and the work, all in one place.

> #### **“The only thing that matters is getting to product-market fit.”**—Marc Andreessen

I’ve noticed that most people (including myself) have only a vague grasp on what product-market fit actually is. And even fewer people are going after it in a systematic way. For my own benefit if nothing else, last year I began collecting the best descriptions of PMF that I could find across [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lennysan/status/1220008309798760449), podcasts, books, and blog posts.

**Below, I’ve put together my favorite (and most actionable) definitions of product/market fit, broken up into pre-product and post-product, and sorted from the most concrete to least concrete.** I’ve also added my favorite guides for _finding_ PMF. If you’ve come across anything better, or have gone through this journey yourself and have a story to share, [I’d love to hear it](https://twitter.com/lennysan).


Subscribe

## What to look for Pre-Product

### **1\. Visible excitement**

> “The real metric for both consumer apps and enterprise is — **do someone’s pupils dilate when they use your stuff**? Whether you’re handing them a demo or if you drew something on the whiteboard. Do they say, ‘You’re not leaving’ or ‘Where have you been all of my life?’”
>
> — [Steve Blank (at 1:30m](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/steve-blank-great-entrepreneurship-is-artistry/id1488560647?i=1000459113604))

> “You have very strong customer feedback, even from a small group of people. For example, at Color early on, we were **getting literal love letters** from customers.”
>
> — [Elad Gil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9v0v5TLZKzA)

### **2\. People are willing to pay for it now**

> “Are people willing to pay you for this product? Ask them this directly. Even try to get them to pay you now (i.e. literally send them an invoice) to get early access to the product. **Nothing will be a better signal of interest and PMF if you can get people to put down money before you have a product.** Try this even if it’s a consumer app that you won’t charge for — it’ll show you how much value you’re creating in people’s lives.”

## What to look for Post-Product

### **1\. Retention: Users stick around**

> “Plot the % active users over time (for various cohorts) to create a retention curve. **If it flattens off at some point, you have probably found product/market fit** for some market or audience.
>
> — [Brian Balfour](https://brianbalfour.com/essays/product-market-fit)

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!elDn!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbcbaf204-650d-484c-9abd-3c61f457c58e_500x333.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!elDn!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbcbaf204-650d-484c-9abd-3c61f457c58e_500x333.png)

> “Do a cohort analysis. Look at a group of people that tried your product in a period of time (e.g. during one month). Then look at how many of those people continue to use your product later (e.g. 12 months later). You will have a fairly deep drop-off on the first month, that’s OK. What you want to know is, does it flatten somewhere? If it flattens, that means **there is a group of customers that are finding value in your product, which means you have PMF**, at least for those customers. The ability to acquire users at less than the amount of money you make from that curve represents your true product/market fit.
>
> — [Casey Winters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpnYFG1-rdk)

> “Long term cohort retention is the best metric for determining if there is product market fit. Once you have a few cohorts that level off at a vertical-specific number, then you’ve achieved product market fit!
>
> Different types of products have different points of product market fit, so it’s important to find the retention rate of some comparable products that have been able to significantly grow to find the right benchmark for you.”
>
> — [Jeff Chang](https://www.growthengblog.com/blog/the-best-metric-for-determining-quantitative-product-market-fit)

### **2\. Surveys: Users say they’d be very disappointed if your product went away**

> “Survey your users and ask them ‘How would you feel if you could no longer use the product?’ and measure the percent who answer ‘very disappointed.’ **If that percentage is over 40%, you have PMF**.”
>
> — [Sean Ellis / Rahul Vohra](https://firstround.com/review/how-superhuman-built-an-engine-to-find-product-market-fit/)

> “For enterprise businesses, at the end of your free trial, you should pull the trial. **If the customer doesn’t scream, you don’t have PMF**. Because if they aren’t going to buy it at the end of the 30 days, they aren’t desperate. And if they aren’t desperate, you don’t have PMF.”
>
> — [Doug Leone / Andy Rachleff](https://greatness.floodgate.com/episodes/andy-rachleff-on-how-to-know-if-youve-got-product-market-fit-XxGvX8DH/transcript)

### **3\. Exponential organic growth**

> “For consumer apps, you start to experience **‘exponential organic growth’**, driven by word of mouth.”
>
> — [Andy Rachleff (starting at 3:00](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/andy-rachleff-on-how-to-know-if-youve-got-product-market-fit/id1488560647?i=1000458416917))

> “The only way you know if you’ve built what customers want is because **they are using it in an explosive and destructive way**. If you are not getting explosive usage you are not building what customers want, or there aren’t that many customers which means you don’t have a big business.
>
> — [Michael Seibel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBOLk9s9Ci4&feature=youtu.be)

> “I think the right initial metric is ‘ **do any users love our product so much they spontaneously tell other people** to use it?’
>
> — [Sam Altman](https://blog.samaltman.com/before-growth)

> “ **Organic growth is the key indicator of product/market fit**. People love to seem smart and cool. They want to recommend something great to their friends. They don’t need a share button to do it. If they love your product, they will tell people about it. **Ideally more than 50% of your new accounts come from direct or organic traffic.**”
>
> — [Merci Victoria Grace](https://medium.com/@merci/wtf-is-product-market-fit-8fd9df41c573)

> “If you’re a SaaS company and **you have major brands finding and using you organically, and paying for your product, that’s a sign of PMF**. Examples of that would be PagerDuty, which had Apple as an early customer. Zeplin, which had Facebook using them very early. Airtable has all sorts of brands that have adopted it.”
>
> — [Elad Gil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9v0v5TLZKzA)

### **4\. Cost-efficient growth**

> Burn Multiple = Net Burn / Net New ARR
>
> The higher the Burn Multiple, the more the startup is burning to achieve each unit of growth. The lower the Burn Multiple, the more efficient the growth is.
>
> This is a Measure of Product-Market Fit. The startup that generates $1M million in ARR by burning $2M is more impressive than one that does it by burning $5M. **In the former case, it appears that the market is pulling product out of the startup, whereas in the latter case, the startup is pushing its product onto the market. VCs will make inferences about product-market fit accordingly.**
>
> — [David Sacks](https://medium.com/craft-ventures/the-burn-multiple-51a7e43cb200)

> “For enterprise businesses, look at the contribution margin of a sales team, divided by the total cost to field the sales team… A sales team may cost on the order of $500k - $600k. **When a company gets to a sales yield of greater than 1.0, that’s how you know you’ve hit PMF.”**
>
> — [Andy Rachleff (starting at 4:30](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/andy-rachleff-on-how-to-know-if-youve-got-product-market-fit/id1488560647?i=1000458416917))

### **5\. CAC < LTV**

> “You have found product/market fit when you can **repeatably acquire customers for a lower cost than what they are worth to you**.”
>
> — [Elizabeth Yin](https://twitter.com/dunkhippo33/status/1153779854614990848)

> “Here’s my simple definition of product/market fit: **The value of each user is greater than the cost of bringing them into the product**. It means there are enough customers out there and you can efficiently bring them in”
>
> — [Nikhyl Singhal](https://firstround.com/review/how-to-craft-your-product-team-at-every-stage-from-pre-product-market-fit-to-hypergrowth/)

> “You have PMF when you see retention that creates enough $ or content/virality to drive sustainable acquisition.”
>
> — [Casey Winters](https://twitter.com/onecaseman/status/1230533020727304192)

### **6\. Customers clamor for your product**

> “You can always feel product/market fit when it's happening. **The customers are buying the product just as fast as you can make it -- or usage is growing just as fast as you can add more servers**. Money from customers is piling up in your company checking account. You're hiring sales and customer support staff as fast as you can. Reporters are calling because they've heard about your hot new thing and they want to talk to you about it. You start getting entrepreneur of the year awards from Harvard Business School. Investment bankers are staking out your house. You could eat free for a year at Buck's.”
>
> — [Marc Andreessen](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html)

> “ **Are people grabbing the product out of your hands** saying I want it, or I'm using it, or I'm buying it, or I’m downloading it, or I'm giving you my email address.”
>
> — [Steve Blank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PR-8_6AzP8)

> “Founding a startup is deciding to take on the burden of Sisyphus: pushing a boulder up a hill.
>
> Pushing a boulder: don’t have product/market fit. Chasing a boulder: have product/market fit. Both are very demanding, but feel totally different. If you’re still pushing the boulder, you don’t have it yet.”
>
> — [Emmett Shear](https://twitter.com/eshear/status/1155180521485242368)

### **7\. People are using it even when it’s broken**

> “ **If your product is broken and people are still using it**, if you have high retention with a broken product, that’s a clear sign you have PMF. When Twitter was constantly going down in the fail whale days, and no one moved off of Twitter. That was a sign of raw market adoption.”
>
> — [Elad Gil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9v0v5TLZKzA)

> “A great measure of product/market fit, particularly in consumer, is **when a company is growing quickly despite poor execution and management**.”
>
> — [Brett Berson](https://twitter.com/brettberson/status/1207182947582767106)

> “When the customers want your products so badly that **you can screw everything up and still succeed**.”
>
> — Don Valentine

> “ **Product/market fit isn’t a one-time, discrete point in time** that announces itself with trumpet fanfares. Competitors arrive, markets segment and evolve, and stuff happens—all of which often make it hard to know you’re headed in the right direction before jamming down on the accelerator.”

Thanks Lenny! I found the Sean Ellis / Rahul Vohra framework of measuring and growing PMF very actionable. Did some more research and wrote about it here: [https://productlessons.substack.com/p/growing-your-product-market-fit](https://productlessons.substack.com/p/growing-your-product-market-fit)

Hi Lenny,

In your "Guides for finding product/market fit," I actually wrote the article you list as item #1, not Eric Ries (I see that the byline isn't clear and just says "Lean Startup Co. Education Program"). I wrote the article in conjunction with a talk I gave at the 2015 Lean Startup Conference where I shared advice from my book The Lean Product Playbook: [https://amzn.to/2WUMFLr](https://amzn.to/2WUMFLr).

If you could please update the author and title, I'd appreciate it.

Thanks. And I'd be happy to chat with you about product-market fit anytime.

It’s 2012 and our team has just joined Airbnb. We’re tasked with building out a “social travel” experience for Airbnb travelers. The thinking is that travelers on Airbnb are siloed across the city, and if we make it easier for guests to meet up and do things together, Airbnb trips would be significantly more meaningful. We work long and hard to design an amazing experience for travelers to discover fun local things to do with other travelers.

Fast forward to 6 months later when we launch the V1 in San Francisco. The product is beautiful and the experiences smooth. Adoption however…not so much 📉. A small percentage of travelers give it a shot, and it generally goes OK, however it’s far from the reaction we were looking for. We iterate a bit, make some incremental improvements, but a few months later we end it and move on.

An early design of the product we launched, giving Airbnb travelers an easy way to find fun things to do with other travelers — designs courtesy of [Shaun Modi](http://shaunmodi.com/meetups)

I personally took many learnings away from that experience, but most of all it instilled in me the importance of getting the problem statement right. Though many factors contribute to a project’s failure, **nothing is more certain to cause a project to fail than a misunderstanding of the problem you are solving**.In the example above, we recognized too late that the real problem we should have been solving was not “travelers want to hang out with other travelers”, but instead, “travelers want to find high quality non-touristy things to do.” Hanging out with other travelers is one solution to this, not the actual problem. Luckily another team recognized this and ended up launching a much better solution, [Airbnb Experiences](https://www.airbnb.com/s/experiences), a few years later.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:179/1*p87h1AWmXjoTYB515jzLcg.png)

As I noted in [my last post](https://medium.com/@lennysan/what-seven-years-at-airbnb-taught-me-about-building-a-company-e1d035d49c56), I firmly believe that nailing the problem statement is the single most important step in solving any problem. It’s deceptively easy to get wrong, and when done well it’s a superpower of the best leaders. Luckily all it takes is three simple steps:

- **Step 1: Crystallize the problem you are solving**
- **Step 2: Align on the problem with your team and stakeholders**
- **Step 3: Keep coming back to the problem**

> “True happiness occurs only when you find the problems you enjoy having and enjoy solving.” — Mark Manson ( [The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019MMUA8S/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1))

### A little bit of context first

This framework is most effective when you have a project in mind, either a new product or a new feature. Before you dive into design or engineering, go through the following steps to set your project up for success.

If your team doesn’t have a clear vision (i.e. where you’re going) or overall strategy (i.e. how you’ll get there), pause here and figure these things out first; [this](http://boz.com/articles/strategy-tactics.html), [this](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2013/04/how-to-create-alignment-within-your-company.html), and [this](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Strategy-Bad-Difference-Matters-ebook/dp/B004J4WKEC/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3SUB4MWG7602M&keywords=good+strategy+bad+strategy&qid=1554495219&s=gateway&sprefix=good+strategy+bad%2Caps%2C204&sr=8-1) will help.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:358/1*eYteKcuBtmMgHS4AjqeZFw.png)

This guide is most helpful at the tactics level

## Step 1: Crystallize the problem you are solving

Start by answering these questions about your project:

- _Description: What is it?_
- _Problem: What problem is this solving?_
- _Why: How do we know this is a real problem and worth solving?_
- _Success: How do we know if we’ve solved this problem?_
- _Audience: Who are we building for?_
- _What: What does this look like in the product?_

You can also use this handy [1-Pager template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1541V32QgSwyCFWxtiMIThn-6n-2s7fVWztEWVa970uo/edit) ( [copy it here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1541V32QgSwyCFWxtiMIThn-6n-2s7fVWztEWVa970uo/copy)). I find it most effective if a single person takes the first pass (usually the PM, but doesn’t have to be). Below is a bit more detail on question.

### Description: What is it?

This is just a brief description of what you’re thinking, so that folks reading this doc can quickly grok what this project is all about. Keep it brief.

### Problem: What problem is this solving?

The problem statement itself is foundational so spend extra time there. Think of the problem like a hypothesis. What do you believe the problem you are solving is, and why? You’ll add more context later. Key attributes of a strong problem statement include:

1. **It’s short.** Aim for a single sentence to describe the actual problem. The more you need to explain it, the less clear the problem ends up being.
2. **It’s focused.** It includes just a single clear problem that can be owned by a single team and solved in a reasonable amount of time. It’s often very helpful to add some examples of what problem you are \*not\* solving.
3. **It references a “need” that is not being fulfilled.** Try to focus this around a user need, but can also be a business need if necessary. The [Jobs-To-Be-Done framework](https://jtbd.info/2-what-is-jobs-to-be-done-jtbd-796b82081cca) is especially useful here.
4. **It includes a what and a why.** What’s going wrong, and why is it a problem? You’ll need to back this up in the next section.
5. **It’s agnostic of a solution.** Resist the urge to jump to a solution this early.

Examples of good problem statements:

- Lyft drivers are cancelling rides too often because the passengers are too far away.
- Airbnb hosts are feeling frustrated because they want to improve, but are finding it difficult to figure out how.
- Users are dropping off at too high a rate at the final step of the signup flow.

Examples of bad problem statements:

- User growth is slowing. \[Issue: Too broad for this process, see advice on approaching big picture strategy [here](http://boz.com/articles/strategy-tactics.html) and [here](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Strategy-Bad-Difference-Matters-ebook/dp/B004J4WKEC/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3SUB4MWG7602M&keywords=good+strategy+bad+strategy&qid=1554495219&s=gateway&sprefix=good+strategy+bad%2Caps%2C204&sr=8-1). Also not user-centric.\]
- Build a loyalty program. \[Issue: Assumes a solution. What’s the problem this is solving?\]
- Users are bouncing from the signup flow. \[Issue: Not focused enough, and missing a hypothesis of the why. Go one level deeper.\]

### Why: How do we know this is a real problem and worth solving?

This is where you collect evidence backing up your problem statement, aka hypothesis. What initially convinced you that this was a problem? What makes it clear to you that this problem needs to be tackled?

Sometimes at this step you realize this problem isn’t actually worth prioritizing right now, or that you need to adjust how you think about the problem. That’s the whole point of this exercise, so don’t resist it. There are infinite problems to tackle — your goal is to feel confident that this problem is worth your team’s time right now.

A few tips for this step:

1. **Look at both quantitative and qualitative evidence.** Collect all data points that point to this being a real and important problem.
2. **Quality over quantity.** Three to five strong data points is far better than a dozen tangentially related points. Your case ends up being weaker with too many items because often you end up filling it with minor and unrelated data points to make it look like a lot of evidence. Your case doesn’t have to be perfect or air-tight.
3. **Play devil’s advocate with yourself.** Try to convince yourself that this isn’t actually a real or big enough problem. What gaps do you have in your evidence? Is the evidence truly telling you what you think? Push yourself here.

In the end it’ll be judgement call amongst many tradeoffs. Your job is to make the best case you can with the data you have. Continue refining the problem statement as you learn more.

### Success: How do we know if we’ve solved this problem?

Did you achieve what you set out to achieve? How will you know? Answer that question and write it down in this section.

> “Did I do that or did I not do that? Yes? No? Simple.” — Andy Grove

This criteria becomes incredibly important throughout the project because it helps you make decisions and prioritize. Does feature X increase the chances of achieving the goal you set? If not, cut it.

Ideally this is a specific metric, with a defined goal, that you can easily measure. Ideally it directly connects to your team’s KPI’s. Ideally it is based on hard data about the opportunity size, investment size, and a heuristic from past experiments. Rarely is it ever ideal. Here is some advice for defining your success criteria:

- Try hard to make it a concrete number, e.g., 10% increase in X, 50% decrease in Y, 20% adoption of feature Z within 3 months.
- Pick a goal that’s believable, but ambitious. What’s a goal that if you were to hit, your team and your leaders would be excited about?
- If you don’t think a metric makes sense for your goal (think long and hard about this), write out what concretely the world would look like if this was a big success. Make that the success criteria.

### Audience: Who are we building for?

This is pretty self-explanatory. It should rarely be for all of your users. Is it for new or returning users? Is it for casual or power users? Is it for users on mobile or web? etc.

### What: What does this look like in the product?

This is where you take a shot at describing the solution to the problem. Depending on the way your team operates, and how much is already known, this can be very high level or very detailed. In my experience the key here is aligning with your designer(s) to figure out how much detail they want and what would be most helpful in the process.

## Step 2: Align on the problem with your team and stakeholders

Have you ever seen those Chipotle billboards along the highway (pictured below)? Years ago my co-worker [Peter](https://twitter.com/PeterKirwan) pointed out the trick behind these ads — each of us is picturing our most ideal and delicious ideal burrito inside of that silver burrito. We all see what we want to see.

[Source](https://imgur.com/gallery/LGLSn)

**Problem statements are like silver burritos.** Everyone on your team has a unique version of the problem in their heads. Sometimes they are nearly identical. Sometimes they are very different. The larger and more complex the project, them more likely they are different. Your job is to eradicate this misalignment early and often. Open up the wrapper and make sure everyone agrees on the burrito inside. Luckily we have a great document from Step 1 that will make your job 10x easier.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:274/1*y7-8Na8l5NdZ5392laqgqA.png)

I usually approach this step like so:

1. I take a crack at Step 1 (but again, it can be anyone on your team that’s passionate about the particular problem)
2. Share the draft with the entire team that’ll be involved in this project. Ask for feedback (in comments, in email, or in person). Integrate the feedback, and re-share.
3. If the feedback is converging and the team seems aligned, great. If not, pull everyone together and chat through disagreements in person.
4. Once your team is aligned, share with your stakeholders. It’s extremely important that your team and the folks judging your success are aligned on the problem you are solving before you get too deep into design/eng.
5. Bring the team together for an in-person kickoff where you again review the problem statement, answer any outstanding questions, and make sure your team has everything they need to get rolling.

## Step 3: Keep coming back to the problem

The classic Seinfeld clip below, where Jerry and Elaine attempt to get a car they previously reserved, is a great metaphor for a classic trap in product development.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:478/1*rf7j7rOCqV4i4HUc4UTNjA.gif)

[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaPxSsK6ZQA) / NBC

**We often start with great intentions and alignment, but when it counts most — when the work is actually being done — we often don’t hold on to the problem we set out to solve.** And that’s the most important part of the problem.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:320/1*jkS4xxNrYSVsL-SlfNGn1Q.png)

A number of years ago I remember working on a project where we were building a dashboard for Airbnb hosts. The initial problem we defined and aligned around was reducing host response time —shrinking the average time it took a host to respond to a guest’s message. Our hypothesis was that hosts would respond more quickly if their unread messages were more prominent, and were also reminded that reply time impacts their search ranking. In the end we were right, but throughout the project, as the scope and complexity grew (pro tip: dashboards are a classic “silver burrito” problem), I found myself having to repeatedly remind the team what problem we set out to solve.Nothing helps reduce scope creep more than coming back to the problem statement and the success metrics. **You can solve many problems in many ways, but you can also build a beautiful product that solves no problems.**

Avoid this trap with a few good habits:

1. In every design review, make sure the designers start by reviewing the problem statement. If it’s not clear, ask “What problem are we trying to solve?”
2. In every progress update to stakeholders, review the problem statement to make sure everyone continues to be aligned on the outcome.
3. Before finalizing designs make sure to ask yourself: “Am I feeling confident this is going to solve the problem we set out to solve?”

## A final note

We are all professional problem solvers—technical problems, interpersonal problems, organizational problems, etc. You won’t escape solving problems.

> “Problems are constant in life. When you solve your health problem by buying a gym membership, you create new problems, like having to get up early to get to the gym on time, sweating like a meth-head for thirty minutes on an elliptical, and then getting showered and changed for work so you don’t stink up the whole office. When you solve your problem of not spending enough time with your partner by designating Wednesday night “date night”, you generate new problems, such as figuring out what to do every Wednesday that you both won’t hate…Problems never stop; they merely get exchanged and/or upgraded.”

Any time spent refining your problem-solving skill, in yourself and in your team, is time well spent. If you’d like to take this even further there are five books I highly recommend:

# Lenny Rachitsky's Product Strategy Essentials

Most product managers would agree that developing a successful product strategy is challenging.

Lenny Rachitsky, an experienced product leader, provides a practical framework for crafting an effective strategy that solves real customer problems.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore Lenny's approach to market analysis, understanding users, formulating a customer-centric strategy, iterative development based on feedback, and measuring success. We'll also review real-world examples of companies applying his teachings, like **Evernote**, **Superhuman**, and **Calm**.

## Introduction to Product Strategy with Lenny Rachitsky

Lenny Rachitsky is an experienced [product management](https://www.theproductfolks.com/product-management-blog) leader, having worked at several top technology companies like Airbnb and Uber. He is known for his expertise in developing effective product strategies that solve real customer problems.

Rachitsky emphasizes the importance of truly understanding users' needs and designing iterative solutions, rather than building products based on assumptions. By continually testing and evolving, teams can create robust products that customers love.

### Discovering Lenny Rachitsky's Expertise

With over a decade in product management, Lenny Rachitsky has established himself as a thought leader in the field. He previously led growth teams at **Airbnb** and **Uber**, helping scale those companies during periods of rapid expansion.

During his time at Airbnb, Rachitsky focused on growth experiments like adding instant book functionality. At Uber, he managed regional growth teams and helped launch UberPOOL.

This hands-on experience at high-growth startups has given Rachitsky deep insight into what works when developing and launching technology products. He's since shared those learnings publicly through conferences, podcasts, and writing.

### Foundations of a Robust Product Strategy

At the core of Rachitsky's product philosophy is truly understanding users' needs before building anything. He eschews assumptions in favor of research - talking to customers, analyzing data and market trends.

Once key user needs are identified, Rachitsky advocates for rapid prototyping and iteration. By starting small and testing continually, [product teams](https://academy.theproductfolks.com/#/allsessions) can evolve the product in the right direction vs. over-investing upfront in the wrong, untested solution.

> "Build the smallest possible product that will enable user feedback, and improve iteratively based on what you learn," Rachitsky advises.

This focus on **customer needs** and [**iterative development**](https://www.theproductfolks.com/product-management-glossary/terms/iterative-design) forms the foundation of Rachitsky's strategic approach to product management.

### Navigating the Article's Insights

In the following sections, we'll explore Rachitsky's teachings on **market analysis**, determining what problems to solve, and balancing user needs with business goals. We'll also look at his suggested processes for iterative product development and methods for continual experimentation and growth.

By covering these key areas of strategic product management, readers will come away with a comprehensive understanding of Rachitsky's philosophy and how to apply it within their organizations. The goal is to provide practical frameworks and advice that product teams can start putting into practice right away to build great products users love.

## Executing Market Analysis for Product Strategy

Lenny Rachitsky emphasizes the importance of thoroughly analyzing your target market before developing a product strategy. This involves assessing key factors like market size, growth trends, customer segmentation, competitors, and opportunity gaps.

### Assessing Market Size and Trends

To determine if a market opportunity exists, you first need to evaluate:

- **Total Addressable Market (TAM)** \- The total revenue opportunity available for your product. Estimate the overall market size that your product could reach.
- **Market growth trends** \- Is the market expanding or contracting? Study historic growth rates and future projections. Prioritize growing markets.

Solid market opportunity analysis provides the foundation for your entire product strategy.

### Segmenting Potential Customers

With the TAM defined, break it down by segmenting who your target customers could be:

- **Demographic** \- Age, gender, income level, etc.
- **Geographic** \- Country, city, climate, etc.
- **Behavioral** \- Purchase motivations, usage patterns, decision making roles, etc.
- **Psychographic** \- Attitudes, interests, values, lifestyles, etc.

Get very specific in your segmentation to deeply understand potential target customer groups.

### Competitive Landscape and Opportunity Gaps

Conduct competitive analysis by charting out existing market solutions and ranking them on factors like features, pricing, target segments, etc.

Look for gaps where competitors are failing to effectively satisfy customer needs. These gaps represent prime **opportunities** for new product solutions.

Iteratively analyze and refine your market opportunity hypotheses. Adapt product strategy based on updated learning.

## Uncovering Customer Needs for Product Success

Understanding customer needs is critical for developing successful products, according to Lenny Rachitsky. He advocates using both qualitative and quantitative methods to deeply understand target users and identify product opportunities.

### Extracting Qualitative Customer Insights

Conducting user research through **interviews**, **observation**, and [**ethnography**](https://www.theproductfolks.com/product-management-glossary/terms/design-ethnography) reveals qualitative insights about customer pain points and desires.

- **Interviews** with target users help uncover their struggles, goals, and thought processes. Ask open-ended questions to elicit detailed responses.
- **Observation** reveals how customers actually use products and what friction points they encounter.
- Rachitsky recommends **ethnographic** research where product teams embed themselves with target users to gain first-hand understanding of their lives and challenges.

### Utilizing Quantitative Data to Inform Strategy

Analyzing **usage metrics** and other quantitative data informs product strategy by revealing customer behaviors and needs.

- Evaluate metrics like DAU/MAU, retention cohorts, funnel drop off to uncover engagement and adoption challenges.
- **A/B testing** features with target user segments provides clarity on what resonates.
- Analyze support tickets, NPS surveys, app reviews to identify recurring pain points.

Synthesizing quantitative and qualitative data provides a 360-degree view of the customer to inform planning.

### Creating User Personas for Targeted Development

Consolidating research into representative [**user personas**](https://www.theproductfolks.com/product-management-glossary/terms/personas) keeps the focus on customer needs during product development.

- Personas include details like user goals, behaviors, pain points, and product needs.
- Mapping personas to target customer segments enables tailored solutions.
- Referencing personas in strategy discussions grounds decisions in customer reality.

Keeping personas front and center ensures the product evolves to effectively serve target users.

## Formulating a Customer-Centric Product Strategy

Lenny Rachitsky is an experienced product management leader who emphasizes the importance of putting the customer at the center of product strategy. He provides valuable insights on how to transform customer research into an actionable roadmap that delivers extreme value.

### Identifying Your Core Customer Base

Using qualitative and quantitative research, you can determine:

- **Demographic** information like age, location, gender, income level
- **Psychographic** attributes like personality, values, attitudes, interests
- **Behaviors** like usage, spending habits, decision making process
- **Pain points** that your product can potentially solve

This allows you to create detailed [customer personas](https://academy.theproductfolks.com/#/allcourses) representing your target users and where they struggle.

> As Lenny suggests, **"If you want to build products that customers love, you need to understand what your customers love."**

### Articulating a Strong Value Proposition

With core users identified, summarize the extreme value you will provide in an inspiring vision statement.

> As Lenny emphasizes, this should capture **"the transformation that happens in a customer's life before and after adopting your product."**

An effective value proposition framework popularized by Lenny is:

- For \[target customer\]
- Who \[has the following problem/need\]
- Our product is \[name of product\]
- That provides \[key benefit statement\]

### Strategizing a Prioritized Product Roadmap

Lenny advocates building a **prioritized roadmap** that methodically tackles the most pressing customer problems revealed through research. This allows you to iteratively deliver value, measure feedback, and refine understanding of users over time.

As Lenny suggests, roadmaps should:

- Map features to specific target users and their struggles
- Prioritize solutions to the most painful problems first
- Schedule releases in iterative cycles to gather feedback

> This aligns well with Lenny's advice that **"Product strategy is an iterative process, not a point in time."** Continually evolving understanding of users is key for any [successful product leader](https://academy.theproductfolks.com/course/product-led-growth).

## Iterative Development: Agile Execution of Product Strategy

Iterative development is a key principle emphasized by Lenny Rachitsky for executing an effective product strategy. He advocates for rapid experimentation and tight feedback loops to validate product concepts with real users.

### The Importance of Prototyping

Prototyping allows teams to quickly test hypotheses by building simplified versions of a product. As Rachitsky highlights, prototypes should focus on testing the riskiest assumptions and can range from paper sketches to coded MVPs. Some tips he provides on effective prototyping include:

- Start with low-fidelity prototypes like flow diagrams or paper prototypes to map user journeys
- Add interactivity with tools like Figma and InVision to simulate real apps
- Use no-code tools like Bubble or Webflow for quick coded prototypes
- Focus on the critical 20% of features that will validate or invalidate your hypothesis

The key is to invest the minimum effort required to start getting feedback. [High-fidelity prototypes](https://www.theproductfolks.com/product-management-glossary/terms/high-fidelity-prototype) take more time and should be built later.

### Accelerating Feedback Loops

To accelerate feedback loops, Rachitsky suggests techniques like guerrilla user testing to get quick qualitative insights. Some methods include:

- Recruit 5 users a week for short 15-30 minute video calls to view prototypes
- Identify key tasks and have users think aloud as they try to accomplish them
- Ask open-ended questions to uncover pain points and desires
- Iterate on prototypes daily based on insights learned

Other feedback channels like in-product surveys, user interviews, concept tests, and A/B tests can provide quantitative validation. The faster you can iterate, the quicker you can find product-market fit.

### Iterating and Refining Based on Feedback

Rachitsky is a strong proponent of the build-measure-learn cycle for iterating on products. This involves:

- **Building** simplified prototypes to test hypotheses
- **Measuring** via user tests and other feedback channels
- **Learning** by analyzing results to uncover insights
- **Iterating** by rapidly updating prototypes based on insights

By repeating this process, teams can refine their product strategy and features to maximize value delivered to users. Rachitsky emphasizes that strategy should adapt based on evidence from real users - not hypotheticals or gut feelings. Prototyping and testing with users is vital for product-market fit.

## Measuring Success in Product Management

### Choosing Impactful Performance Metrics

Defining the right metrics to measure is critical for understanding product-market fit and guiding strategy. As Lenny Rachitsky notes, focusing on vanity metrics like sign-ups and engagement can mask whether you are actually solving customer needs. **Lenny Rachitsky** advocates measuring customer lifecycle milestones that indicate you are truly delivering value. This includes metrics like activation rates, retention over time, and revenue growth. Setting goals for these metrics keeps teams focused on moving customers along the journey from awareness to loyal usage and expansion.

To select the vital few metrics to track, **Lenny Rachitsky** recommends identifying key questions you want to answer. Are you evaluating new feature adoption? Monitoring cohort retention trends? Benchmarking sales cycle length? Document the questions, map them to metrics, and track in a centralized dashboard. Review regularly as a team to discuss insights, trends and required actions.

### Analyzing Customer Usage for Strategic Insights

In addition to core lifecycle metrics, **Lenny Rachitsky** stresses [analyzing customer usage for strategic insights](https://academy.theproductfolks.com/course/product-analytics-101). This means tapping into in-product telemetry to see exactly how customers interact with key features and flows. For example, you can breakdown conversion rates by traffic source to identify best acquisition channels. Or assess feature adoption rates by user segment to prioritize enhancements for your most valuable customers.

**Lenny Rachitsky** advocates not just looking at usage volumes, but also evaluating qualitative feedback on specific features. Survey ratings, NPS scores by feature area, and vocal customer feedback all provide clues into satisfaction levels. Triangulate these signals to uncover friction points and opportunities to better address customer needs.

### Engaging Customers for Ongoing Feedback

While analyzing usage data provides valuable insights, **Lenny Rachitsky** emphasizes directly engaging customers through interviews and research. This helps uncover the "why" behind metrics and evolving needs that are hard to extract from data alone.

He recommends continually interviewing users across segments to check product assumptions and learn about use cases you may have overlooked. Be systematic in your outreach cadence based on customer lifecycle stage, inviting both detractors and promoters to avoid selection bias. Synthesize findings into evolving user personas that feed back into roadmap prioritization.

In closing, **Lenny Rachitsky** notes that great product leaders view metrics and customer feedback as two sides of the same coin. Quantitative data informs the what behind customer behavior, while qualitative insights explain the why to guide strategic decision making. Taking a balanced approach is key for data-driven product discovery.

## Navigating Common Challenges in Product Strategy

As an influential thought leader in product management, Lenny Rachitsky frequently encounters teams struggling with core aspects of product strategy. By drawing on his extensive experience, Rachitsky provides practical advice for overcoming three common pitfalls.

### Focusing on Solutions Before Problems

Rachitsky emphasizes the importance of deeply understanding customer problems before designing potential solutions. As he advises:

> "Spend more time researching the problem space and less time brainstorming solutions. Resist the urge to jump to UX sketches and product specs without evidence that customers urgently need this specific solution."

He recommends techniques such as customer interviews, surveys, and observational studies to unpack where customers are struggling. Immersing yourself in these pain points allows innovative solutions to naturally emerge.

Rachitsky explains that **"lenny rachitsky product management"** requires balancing customer obsession with business viability. While customers can articulate their frustrations, they often cannot envision the optimal solution. Digging into problems equips teams to then ideate solutions that perfectly address core struggles.

### Overcoming the Hurdle of Analysis Paralysis

In striving to deeply understand customer problems, Rachitsky cautions teams against analysis paralysis. He advocates finding the right balance between research and rapid experimentation, sharing:

> "Research enough to identify a beachhead customer segment and their acute need. Then quickly build an MVP to validate that need and iterate based on real-world feedback."

Rachitsky points out that endless analysis rarely uncovers every minor customer preference. At some point, you must launch an initial product and refine based on behavioral data and customer interviews. **Iterative development** with real users accelerates learning.

He suggests focusing research on the riskiest assumptions and then testing those assumptions through launching live products. Resist over-indexing on speculative research when you can rapidly experiment in the market.

### Delivering Beyond the Minimum Viable Product

While Rachitsky is a vocal proponent of rapid iteration, he believes teams must ultimately solve the entire customer problem. As he states:

> "The MVP should fully address a subset of the customer's struggle. But you need to build, measure, and learn towards delivering the minimum LOVABLE product that wholly resolves their pain."

Rachitsky points out that the goal of **product strategy** is not simply shipping a bare-bones product. Teams should iteratively build towards a product that customers genuinely love and meaningfully improves their lives. This requires understanding the full spectrum of frustrations and designing comprehensive solutions.

He advocates balancing speed with a commitment to fully address the job customers are hiring your product to perform. Use the MVP to validate demand but have a long-term vision to delight customers by solving all aspects of their struggles.

## Real-World Applications of Rachitsky's Product Strategy Framework

Rachitsky's product strategy principles provide a practical framework for developing successful products that effectively address user needs. Here are some real-world examples of companies leveraging these techniques to drive product-market fit and growth:

### Evernote: A Case Study on User-Centric Feature Development

Evernote conducted extensive user research to deeply understand how their target customers capture information and organize their lives. This enabled them to develop features like automated optical character recognition, advanced search capabilities, and note tagging that directly solved core user pain points around managing information overload.

By relentlessly focusing on addressing extreme users' most pressing problems through new features, Evernote was able to drive rapid user growth and retention. Their approach exemplifies Rachitsky's emphasis on letting customer needs guide product development.

### Superhuman: Achieving Growth by Focusing on Power Users

The email startup Superhuman concentrated on building the perfect product for tech power users from the start. While a niche audience, these influential early adopters generated word-of-mouth growth through enthusiastic recommendations.

Superhuman's core features like lightning fast keyboard shortcuts and scheduling sent emails for optimal open rates catered specifically to power users' needs for efficiency and productivity. This aligns with Rachitsky's advice to focus on a small but passionate user base before expanding to a broader market.

### Calm: Addressing Mental Health with Mindfulness

Calm tapped into the growing mainstream interest in mental health and mindfulness by providing an accessible mobile solution. Features like guided meditations, sleep stories, and breathing programs directly addressed users' needs to reduce anxiety, improve sleep quality, and find inner calm.

Within a few years Calm became the top-grossing health and fitness app with over 50 million downloads. Their success demonstrates the effectiveness of Rachitsky's principle of identifying an emerging mass-market need and addressing it better than competitors.

In summary, thoughtfully applying Rachitsky's core product strategy tenets around understanding users, focusing on their most pressing problems, and iteratively improving the solution can lead to satisfied customers, organic growth, and a sustainable competitive advantage. Companies like Evernote, Superhuman, and Calm provide inspiring examples of product-market fit in action.

## Summarizing Lenny Rachitsky's Product Strategy Essentials

In closing, a recap of the core tenets of Rachitsky’s approach to product strategy focused on understanding customers, rapid iteration and delivering extreme value.

### Emphasizing Research-Driven Ideation

Reiterating importance of upfront **research** before solutioning.

- Conduct thorough **market analysis** to identify customer needs and pain points
- Analyze competitor products to understand current solutions landscape
- Map out customer journey to pinpoint key moments of friction

This upfront legwork ensures product ideas are grounded in real customer problems worth solving.

### Validating Product Concepts Through Experiments

Emphasizing **agile** build-measure-learn methodology.

- Develop minimum viable product (MVP) to test riskiest assumptions
- Release small batches and collect usage data
- Rapidly incorporate feedback into product iterations

Short feedback loops validate product direction aligns to customer needs.

### Prioritizing Extreme Customer Value

Keep delivering on extreme value proposition through continuous evolution.

- Obsess over core customer jobs-to-be-done
- Make iterative improvements to address pain points
- Add delighters that surprise and delight users

Ruthlessly focus on creating disproportionate value for customers.

Summary

Lenny Rachitsky highlights 7 habits of the best product managers.

Learn how to be a good product manager. Discover how to unblock your team, prioritize projects, and stay one step ahead.

When you exhibit these daily habits, you're giving you and your team the best chance at launching a successful product.

* * *

#### What Makes a Great Product Manager

In his course PM Fundamentals, Lenny Rachitsky shares his 7 habits for becoming one of the best product managers. These habits will help product managers make better, faster decisions and improve their roles.

The 7 habits are outlined below in detail. Let's dive in.

##### 1\. Hunt for Blockers

As a [successful product manager](https://maven.com/resources/master-product-management), you need to unceasingly hunt for blockers. Your job is to unblock the team and help them be more successful. The key to becoming one of the best product managers is by ensuring the team is always moving forward and not being held up with unnecessary roadblocks.

According to a recent survey by Forbes, the top cause of project failure is a lack of communication and collaboration between team members.

The best product managers must be able to identify these communication breakdowns and work to resolve them quickly. This could mean having more team meetings, setting up regular check-ins, or finding new tools to help everyone stay on the same page.

###### Example:

For example, suppose you are working on a [go-to-market campaign](https://maven.com/resources/product-growth), and the product marketer cannot get the necessary visuals from the designer.

In that case, it's your job as a product manager to step in and ensure the lines of communication are open. By actively hunting for blockers, you can help keep the project on track and ensure that the team is always moving forward.

##### 2\. Ruthlessly Prioritize

The second habit of a successful product manager is ruthless prioritization of both your time and your team's time.

As a product manager, you need to be able to prioritize the most important tasks and delegate the rest to the team. This means focusing on the tasks that will impact the project most and leaving the rest for later.

According to a study by the Harvard Business Review, the average person spends just over half of their workday on tasks that don't align with their goals or objectives.

This is why the best product managers need to prioritize their time effectively and avoid wasting time on tasks that won't have a significant impact.

###### Example:

If you are working on a project and the deadline is fast approaching, it's important to prioritize the tasks that will impact the project most.

This could mean focusing on design, development, or data analysis tasks. By prioritizing your time effectively, you can help ensure the project is completed on time and within budget.

##### 3\. Amplify Your Team's Success and Contributions

According to a study by the University of California, Berkeley, employees who feel their contributions are valued are more likely to be engaged and motivated at work. Amplifying the success and contributions of your team is a key habit of a successful product manager. People want to work for [leaders who recognize and celebrate their accomplishments](https://maven.com/resources/leadership-skills). This means taking the time to celebrate your team's successes and highlight their contributions to the project.

###### Example:

For example, if you have a team member who has just finished a particularly challenging task, take the time to celebrate their success. This could mean sending a personal email, posting on Slack, or just stopping by their (in-person or virtual) desk to congratulate them.

By amplifying the success and contributions of your team, you can help create a positive and motivated work environment.

##### 4\. Anticipate What's Coming Around the Corner

One essential habit of successful product managers is the ability to anticipate what's coming around the corner.

The best product managers must be able to stay ahead of the curve, anticipate potential problems, and prepare for future challenges.

This habit helps ensure the product manager is always one step ahead, allowing them to manage projects effectively and respond quickly to changes.

###### Example:

For example, a product manager may review market trends, develop a [product roadmap](https://maven.com/resources/product-roadmap), track competitor activity, and monitor customer feedback.

They may also schedule [regular check-ins with their manager](https://maven.com/resources/1-1-meetings), founder, and other key stakeholders to stay informed and anticipate future needs.

By anticipating what's coming around the corner, the best product managers will prepare their team and ensure they are always ready to tackle new challenges.

##### 5\. Frequently Remind Team Members of the Vision and Mission

Frequently reminding team members of the vision and mission is another important habit of successful product managers. A product manager must be able to [connect their team's work to the company's larger goals](https://maven.com/resources/leadership-styles). This habit helps to build motivation, improve focus, and increase engagement.

A product manager who frequently reminds their team of the vision and mission will help to keep the team focused on what is most important, allowing them to make the most progress in the shortest amount of time.

###### Example:

A product manager may begin each meeting by reminding team members of the company's vision and mission. They may also explain how each project supports the company's goals and how individual tasks contribute to the larger picture.

By frequently reminding team members of the vision and mission, the product manager can help to build a stronger sense of purpose and increase motivation.

##### 6\. Have a Point of View

As a product manager, having a point of view is important. New product managers often think their role is coordinating other people's ideas and bringing the best ideas to the surface.

However, it's actually important for product managers to have their perspective and to be able to articulate it effectively. This doesn't mean that you need to be rigid in your thinking. Rather, you should have a flexible perspective that can change based on new information and data.

Having a point of view helps product managers to [think more deeply about decisions](https://maven.com/resources/annie-duke-decision-making) and to be able to articulate their ideas clearly and concisely. When product managers bring their perspective to a discussion, they force themselves to think through the issue more deeply and to consider the implications of different options.

###### Example:

For example, if you're managing a team working on a [new product launch](https://maven.com/resources/product-growth), you may have a point of view on the target market and the key features the product should include.

This perspective will help guide the team's discussions and ensure everyone is working towards a common goal.

##### 7\. Never Drop the Ball

The final habit of a highly successful product manager is to never drop the ball. As product managers, we often juggle many tasks and responsibilities, and it's easy for things to fall through the cracks.

However, it's important to maintain a high level of focus and attention to detail to ensure that everything is done correctly and on time.

When managing a product launch, you need to ensure that all the deadlines are met, that the team is working effectively, and that any issues are resolved promptly. You also need to ensure that the team communicates well and that everyone is aligned on the goals and objectives.

###### Example:

By never dropping the ball, product managers demonstrate their commitment to the team and the project and build trust and credibility with their colleagues.

When product managers consistently deliver on their promises, they establish themselves as reliable leaders who are capable of getting things done.

#### Try These 7 Habits Out and Grow

Incorporating these habits into your daily work will help you become a highly effective and successful product manager who is capable of leading teams to success.

_This article is by_ [_Lenny Rachitsky_](https://twitter.com/lennysan?ref=review.firstround.com) _, a former product lead and head of consumer supply growth at Airbnb, and_ [_Nels Gilbreth_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nels-gilbreth-36a9821/?ref=review.firstround.com) _, former Head of Global Revenue Strategy at Eventbrite._

It's almost the end of Q3, which means annual (and quarterly) planning is just around the corner. If you’re like most people, this sentence just filled you with dread.

We've been through dozens of planning cycles after spending 10 years at **Eventbrite** and seven years at **Airbnb**, so we've seen firsthand how messy and challenging it can be. Sometimes we were still working on our annual plan — three months into the year. Other times a half-assed plan was rushed through approvals, only to be abandoned entirely after only six months. For most of us, by the time planning ends we’re left with bruised egos, misaligned plans, and a lack of buy-in.

On the flip side, we've also seen the power of a great planning process. In one case, a single team took it upon themselves to consistently stay ahead of planning. They were always ready to rock and roll on day one of the quarter, and as a result delivered significant impact more quickly (and with higher morale) than anyone else.

**Planning is hard because it's inherently different from other exercises your organization takes on**. Rather than focusing on day-to-day execution, it requires a large number of people to think about a variety of possible futures, align on one single future, and then plot a concrete course to get there. Taking this on for your own personal goals (for example, a New Year’s resolution), feels challenging enough — doing this with dozens or thousands of people can feel nearly impossible.

> You can’t expect the organization to “just know” how to pull together a quarterly plan. Working without an agreed-upon framework can often be a recipe for disaster.

Below we’ll share a system that we call the **“W Framework**. **”** We hit on this idea after leaving our respective orgs and reminiscing on our experiences coordinating large numbers of people to drive collective impact. We realized that the root cause of nearly all bad planning processes is very simple: **a basic lack of understanding of roles — who is responsible for what, when**. For example, who should have a say in the plan, and when? What exactly does each stakeholder need to deliver, and to whom? Who sets the timelines? Who holds everyone accountable? And who makes the final call? These questions are too often left unanswered, which leads to chaos and disappointment during the planning process.

We’ve used variations of this framework at our respective orgs and have witnessed how it has made planning more predictable, less stressful, and significantly more effective. Below we’ll walk through each step of the process, highlight best practices, and point out common pitfalls. (And at the end, we'll be summarizing everything in full.)

Though using this framework won’t solve every pain in your planning process, we firmly believe it will make planning significantly more effective at almost any org.

_A quick note before we begin:_ This framework is a full top-to-bottom company planning process, most applicable to companies larger than roughly 25 people (once there are multiple teams). It’s intended to help the leaders of the company (i.e. executives, founders) put a planning process in place across the entire org. For individual team leaders, you can advocate for you company to use a framework like this one, and you can also use a scaled down version of this same framework within your own team.

## UNPACKING THE W FRAMEWORK

To begin, you’ll first need to identify the two basic groups that will be involved in planning: the **Leadership** group and the individual **Teams**.

The **Leadership** group is generally the executive staff of the company (the CEO and the people who report to her), or the senior leaders of a business unit (VP of Product, VP of Engineering, President of the business unit, etc.).

The **Teams** are the people executing the actual work, for example the Marketing team, each of the product teams, and the customer service team. As an example of this in action, when Lenny led the supply growth Team, he worked with a Leadership group that included the President of the Homes business unit, the Director of Data Science, the Director of Design, the Director of Engineering, the head of Ops, and a handful of other directors and VPs.

Over several different planning cycles, we’ve seen the extreme ways these roles can play out. We’ve seen Leadership groups that go away to an offsite and come back with a finalized plan without ever involving the Teams. And we’ve seen the opposite: Teams that “take back” planning and do almost all of the work without involving Leadership. What tends to work best in our experience is a balance between these two extremes.

The framework is made up of four steps:

- **1\. Context**: Leadership shares a high-level strategy with Teams
- **2\. Plans**: Teams respond with proposed plans
- **3\. Integration**: Leadership integrates into a single plan, and shares with Teams
- **4\. Buy-in**: Teams make final tweaks, confirm buy-in, and get rolling

![](https://assets.proof.pub/2056/firstround/O6rbG1rNQ2emg8EPj1Xa_TKImage%200%20Leadership%20Frames.png)

To successfully implement this process, or any company planning process for that matter, we recommend the following roles and responsibilities:

**Leadership** (i.e. exec team, business unit leads) is responsible for:

- Developing an inspiring high-level vision and strategy
- Sharing a concrete goal for the period
- Making the final decision on what is prioritized and resourced

**Teams** (i.e. cross-functional product teams) are responsible for:

- Developing execution plans that support the high-level strategy
- Highlighting gaps & risks with the final plan
- Committing to a goal, with a given level of resources

With that high-level framework out of the way, let’s dive into each step. We’ll share examples from our own experiences, templates, and tactics for avoiding common pitfalls.

## STEP 1: LEADERSHIP PROVIDES CONTEXT

_“The first liberating change managers can make to improve the quality of the planning process is to begin it by deliberately and thoughtfully identifying and discussing the strategic issues that will have the greatest impact on future business performance."_— [_McKinsey_](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/how-to-improve-strategic-planning?ref=review.firstround.com)

If there’s one thing you take away from this article, it should be that **good planning requires top-down guidance**. As an example of what can go wrong when this isn’t done, during one of our past planning cycles, the Leadership group (the leaders of our business unit in this case) received a synthesized plan for the year ahead from all of the various Teams. This plan was put together bottom-up, with each team’s more focused plan getting combined into one large plan. The results were eye-opening. There were five times as many priorities as there were teams, and individual team strategies often pulled in opposite directions. When the execs saw this (and had a chance to take a deep breath), they realized the mistake they made.

This issue, at its heart, was that teams lacked context. Teams need to know what investments need to be made now, in order to set the company up for success down the road. They need to know where the biggest risks to the business lie. Leadership has the best understanding of these things, and as planning kicks off, must ensure that this context is communicated.

> Teams need context. They need to know what the company absolutely needs to nail over the next year.

How should Leadership share that context with teams? One of the best ways to do this is to put together and share their first draft of the **Company Strategy.**

## [**Here's our Company Strategy template to get you started.**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JI73WrGplrhNE46aLyRD_B74gEynI77EPgXn1ic6WeQ/edit?ref=review.firstround.com\#)

Eventually, this doc will evolve to become the full company plan, but right now, Leadership should focus on the strategic elements. A good company strategy at this stage gives a succinct overview of what Leadership believes is the path to winning.

The five essentials ingredients to any company strategy document are:

- 1\. Mission - What are you meant to achieve
- 2\. Vision - What does it look like once you’ve achieved it
- 3\. Goal - How do you concretely know you’ve achieved it
- 4\. Strategy - What is the path to achieving it
- 5\. Strategic pillars - Three to five key bets that the company needs to make

![](https://assets.proof.pub/2056/firstround/zZwPLEJSQ8e2k6CMBl97_Image%201%20Company%20Strategy.jpg)

Leadership shouldn’t be too concerned with making the plan too polished at this stage. Planning isn't a time to demonstrate that Leadership has all the answers. It's a time to share what they know and invite others to help fill in the gaps. Leadership needs everyone’s help to complete it. What matters most is that the strategic plan accurately reflects the leaders’ best thinking at this time.

In fact, we encourage Leadership to call out not just what they know but what they _don’t_ know and wish that they did. For example, Leadership may know that they have to expand into the APAC market, even if they don’t have a strong consensus yet on which specific countries to first expand into (or how). If that’s the case, they should state this explicitly, namely, “We know that expansion into Asia is vital for our success and we also believe that Japan is likely where we should focus our efforts. However, we are open to hearing compelling reasons to enter other countries instead of Japan.”

Importantly, the perspective shared by Leadership should not be interpreted as a mandate. It’s important that Leadership provides early input on what they believe is important strategically for the company to get right, _but_ in Step 2 the Teams are encouraged to push back, and to share better approaches.

> You want to leverage the full creativity of the team while also making sure you’re all heading in the same direction.

## **Tips for developing the strategic plan:**

- **Start with listening**: Speak directly with employees on the ground, review past data-dives and research findings, and begin capturing the most interesting ideas.
- **Get a single individual to take the first pass**: Having a strawman proposal for a group to comment and iterate on is far more effective than a group developing a plan together in real-time.
- **Be transparent**: Include context behind your thinking. Call out what you are _sure of_, and what you _think_ might be true.
- **Focus your efforts**: A good strategy is a focused strategy. What do you _absolutely_ need to get right in order to win? What needs to happen now, and what will be just as successful if you do it later?
- **Disagree and commit**: It’s critical the Leadership is aligned by the time it moves to the next step.

## **Common pitfalls at this stage:**

- **Too prescriptive:** Leadership tells the Teams exactly what to do and gives no indication that their feedback is an important step in the planning process. This leads to limited innovation and employee satisfaction.
- **A lack of focus:** Leadership can’t agree among themselves on a strategy or a limited set of priorities. This leads to a ripple effect across all teams, with no holistic strategy and a seemingly limitless list of priorities.
- **No context**: Leadership skips this step completely and instead asks Teams to develop execution plans in a vacuum. While on the surface this can seem like an empowering act by giving the Teams a lot of freedom, in practice it leads to unfocused and misaligned plans.
- **Overthinking it:** Leadership thinks it has to demonstrate it has all of the answers, otherwise the plan doesn’t feel “complete.” Instead, they should focus on sharing what they know, what assumptions they have, and what questions they need help answering.
- **Thinking a doc will be enough context:** Leadership gives all of the Teams a few docs and templates, assuming they’ll have enough context and guidance. However, the more the Teams understand the intangibles, e.g. the “why” behind the vision and strategy, the more likely they are to deliver great results that fall in line with the expectations of Leadership.

> The key to effective planning? Debate vigorously, but unite.

Once the strategic plan is in a decent spot, Leadership needs to identify individuals from the Teams who will own each part of the strategic plan, with whom they’ll share all of this context. For example, if you want to expand into APAC you may select someone on the ground in APAC (e.g. GM of APAC), or someone in HQ that can work closely with local ops folks along with the product team HQ (e.g. Head of International Expansion). Selecting these individuals is key because these people will play a key role during the rest of the planning process. Look for people who have context on the work, are reliable, and can think big while delivering results. It can be surprising how long and how many meetings it can take to effectively share out this context, but in the end, the time is well spent.

Hopefully, you find yourself in an org structure that makes it easy to identify owners (and supporting resources) for the different initiatives — where each strategic initiative fits cleanly into an existing team. If not, pick the people best suited to take this on for the time being.

In parallel, consider the idea of reorganizing your teams to align with your strategy. This may sound painful now, but in our experience, having your strategy inform your structure (versus the other way around) is the only way to be successful long-term. As an example, when Airbnb expanded into the [Experiences](https://www.airbnb.com/s/experiences?ref=review.firstround.com), they could have tasked the existing teams with working together to create this new line of business. Instead the leaders made the right call to create a brand new team that would work relatively independently and report directly into an executive. [Coinbase went through the same learnings](https://firstround.com/review/lessons-from-coinbases-wild-ascent-four-rules-for-scaling/?ref=review.firstround.com), recognizing they should shape their org chart to mold to the product, not the other way around.

Once you have your point person selected, meet with them individually, share all of the context you’ve developed above, and then tell them exactly what you need from them. We recommend Leadership ask for the following deliverables for each of the initiatives they are driving.

## [Here’s our template for developing Key Initiatives](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RQWuvWDgcAv1ylksFXtiwhuTbHLcL1byIcoXsbCQfic/edit?ref=review.firstround.com\#heading=h.c50sltibqqhp):

- 1\. Strategy
- 2\. List of key projects
- 3\. Expected timeline and impact
- 4\. Resources needed
- 5\. Risks and dependencies

![](https://assets.proof.pub/2056/firstround/fxmCWSi7QO2cVJfZL6QM_Image%202%20Key%20Initiative%20Strategy.jpg)

In addition, this is the time to share the full timeline for the planning process. Make sure everyone understands the timelines early on, that a person is on the hook for every item, and that there’s someone responsible for keeping things on track.

## [Here’s our planning timeline template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RTMr9vGCYEhWYA2dKG8EYLDFEtQ1E33W8uDEhmEd8QQ/edit?ref=review.firstround.com).

## STEP 2: TEAMS RESPOND WITH A PROPOSED PLAN

Next, the Teams step up — they take in all of the context provided by Leadership and get to work delivering plans for their initiatives for the year ahead.

Owners of each initiative should assemble a team (often their existing team, sometimes a temporary taskforce) and start thinking about how to best solve the problems they are tasked with. It’s important to remember, particularly at this stage, that everything Leadership has suggested is up for debate. If Teams see major flaws in the proposed plan, or have a better approach, this is the time to highlight these points.

## **Here’s the process that we generally use to figure out a Team plan:**

- **1\. Start early:** Begin to formulate your perspective before planning officially starts. Even though things will change, we find the most successful teams get way ahead of planning (and accurately anticipate Leadership’s asks). If you get it wrong, in the best case you have a ready-to-go better proposal for Leadership, and in the worst case there are valuable chunks you can still use.
- **2\. Begin with the problem:** What distinct problem are you trying to solve? For example, “Grow our business in APAC”, or “Expand into the music vertical.” Make sure everyone is aligned on this problem statement before you get any further. Ideally there’s just one clear problem per team. If your team is a “platform” team that supports other teams, you’ll need to understand other teams’ plans and problems before you can finalize your own plan. Schedule time with each of these teams and align on what you can and can’t do to support them. Let Leadership know upfront that you will need extra time to do your planning, to make time for these alignment sessions.
- **3\. Develop hypotheses:** Work with your team to develop a handful of hypotheses for how to solve this problem. For example, “We will grow our business in APAC by working with a local partner” or “We will expand into the music vertical by signing venues X, Y, Z.” Talk to customers, have team discussions, think solo in a quiet place.
- **4\. Ideate:** For each of the hypotheses, come up with ideas for testing and addressing these hypotheses. [Here are a number of ways to come up with good ideas](https://www.lennyrachitsky.com/p/where-great-product-roadmap-ideas?ref=review.firstround.com).
- **5\. Create a strawman plan:** Similar to Step One, one person (ideally the team lead) should take a first pass at developing the [team plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RQWuvWDgcAv1ylksFXtiwhuTbHLcL1byIcoXsbCQfic/edit?ref=review.firstround.com#).
- **6\. Get feedback, iterate:** Share this early plan with the team, collect feedback, and iterate until you and the team feel good about it. Throughout this process, cull, prioritize, and focus.
- **7\. Sanity check resources:** Come up with your ideal ratios for how you want to invest this year. For example, what percent of resources should be on short, medium, long term bets? What should be the idea ratios for your cross-functional team members? Does your plan match this?
- **8\. Solidify:** Get the proposed plan into a state where the story feels tight and polished. Spend extra time at this stage to make sure _you_ feel good about the proposal. The plan you develop should fit well within the context Leadership has provided. The impact you plan to deliver should be ambitious, but achievable. The resources should be clearly defined and well explained.
- **9\. Get buy-in from teams you will depend on:** Make sure teams you depend on see and buy into the plan before moving on to the next step, especially if they haven’t been a part of this process. This often includes finance (do they buy the goals you are setting), CX (can they support your changes), marketing/sales, and platform teams. Help make Leadership’s job easier by figuring out dependencies and blockers across teams early.

## **Common pitfalls at this stage:**

- **Working in silos:** Teams work independently for too long without checking in with other teams or Leadership. This results in delivering a plan that’s way off the mark and a lot of time lost.
- **Doing exactly what you’re told:** Teams assume the direction they get from Leadership is written in stone. The whole point of this step is for teams to share their unique point of views, based on their experience on the ground. It’s important for Teams to highlight ideas they think are better.
- **Staying inside your box:** Focusing only on your team’s surface area. Instead, explore ideas outside of your direct control. What can other teams do that would positively impact your outcomes? How do you influence them to do that work? Leadership should share pointers here later.

Once your Team plan is solid, package it up and share it with Leadership. In addition to sending a pre-read email, each team should present their plans to the Leadership group in person. This gives the teams a chance to address gaps and concerns before Leadership makes a premature conclusion. Set expectations with your team that things will change after you’ve received feedback — because they most definitely will.

## STEP 3: LEADERSHIP SHARES AN INTEGRATED PLAN

What started in Step One as a good idea, in theory, is now close to being real and concrete. You should have in your hands a set of detailed plans for each of your initiatives — including strategies, projects, impact estimates, and resource requirements. If the plans look way off base, go back and repeat Step One and Two. But if things look good, you can start to finalize the plan.

At this stage, Leadership has three primary jobs:

- Prioritize: Decide which projects and teams are being funded
- Allocate: Distribute resources and targets
- Integrate: Tie everything together into a cohesive company strategy

## You can continue to use [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JI73WrGplrhNE46aLyRD_B74gEynI77EPgXn1ic6WeQ/edit?ref=review.firstround.com\#) to collect the final integrated plan.

Much of the work at this stage involves difficult decisions like what to fund, what to cut, and what to double down on. In order to make these hard decisions, Leadership should have a series of group discussions where they review each plan one by one and begin to develop a single plan. As the plan takes shape, everyone in the Leadership group should constantly be asking each other the following questions:

- 1\. Is the most strategically critical work prioritized and resourced?
- 2\. Are the benefits of each bet worth the investment?
- 3\. Are you confident that the team will execute well and hit their goals? If not, what would make you more confident?
- 4\. Is the team being ambitious enough? Or maybe too ambitious?
- 5\. Are there additional benefits or risks that the team missed?
- 6\. How do you feel about the overall mix of the portfolio of investments? Are you making bets on new things or just investing in things we’ve done before? (A good rule of thumb is to invest 80% in safe, short-term bets, 20% in riskier, long-term bets.)
- 7\. Are you doing too much?

> Remember, plans always get more complicated once they're put into practice — never less.

New priorities emerge, market forces change, and everything takes longer than you expect. Your plan needs focus — likely more focus than you might feel comfortable with. To design a plan that has a real chance of success, put your resources behind a small number of bets (ideally 3, max 5). In our experience when you leave the planning process wondering if you put _too_ many resources behind a single bet, that’s the bet that ends up succeeding.

It can feel risky to place lots of resources behind fewer things. There’s a certain comfort in having lots bets, anyone of which could yield positive results. In our experience though, what can feel like hedging too often ensures that impactful ideas don’t receive the resources they need to thrive.

In the early days of Eventbrite, for example, Nels remembers his team had an aggressive plan to pause many activities in favor of entering a new category in just two quarters. Although it meant saying no to many different things, they successfully entered that category and acquired what would end up being one of their largest customers for several years.

> Pinpoint your highest-impact bets, then go all in. Bold ideas need bold resourcing.

It’s important to challenge yourself and your peers to cut even the good ideas if they aren’t perishable (can be done later), strategic (don’t directly support this plan’s strategy), or differentiating (set you apart from your competition). Instead, put those resources against the top priorities.

Another key consideration during this stage is determining whether the bottom-up plans achieve the stated goals. If so, great! Just make sure these goals are vetted and that you buy into them. If not, that's a problem. Work with finance, data science, and the leaders of each initiative to optimize the expected return from the various initiatives. If the puzzle pieces can’t all come together, you may have to go back to Step Two. Most times, however, with the right level of focus, a solution can be reached with the existing set of initiatives.

## **Common pitfalls at this stage:**

- **Not being aggressive enough:** Leadership accepts underwhelming plans from the Teams — easy to hit goals, uninspired projects, or limited innovation. This is the time to set the bar high and make hard decisions. Don’t be afraid to push back or ask for work to be redone. You can even go back to Step One if that’s what it takes to get the plan done right.
- **Doing too much:** Leadership says yes to too many things. Avoid spreading your resources like [peanut butter](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/the-strategy-and-corporate-finance-blog/why-your-business-needs-a-hit-mentality?ref=review.firstround.com). Do the hard things now. Some people will be upset because things are cut. Remind them how essential it is to get the higher priorities done right.
- **Burying the lead:** Leadership is vague about hard decisions, or they don’t share disappointing news early or clearly enough. This will come out. It’s almost always better to be upfront about it.

Once Leadership has aligned behind an integrated plan, it’s time to move to the final step.

## STEP 4: TEAMS CONFIRM THEIR BUY-IN

This step is often taken for granted or skipped entirely. Instead, Leadership often gives Teams a quick heads up on the final changes, pretends to listen to the feedback, and then shares the plan widely. This is a mistake. Sharing the integrated plans with Team leads needs to be done thoughtfully and carefully. Many team members have spent dozens (sometimes hundreds) of hours developing their plans, getting internal alignment, and iterating. It’s likely many things have changed or have even been cut.

> Rolling out a new plan gives leaders the opportunity to create strong buy-in, trust, and excitement for the work ahead. Don't squander it.

Also, Leadership should use this time to make sure they haven’t missed anything critical while integrating the plans. There’s always a lot going on during planning, and important things can slip through the cracks between teams.

Thus, the three goals of this step are:

- 1\. Share the integrated plan with Team leaders
- 2\. Make final tweaks based on their input
- 3\. Commit and share widely

## **Tips for how to share the integrated plan with the least amount of drama:**

- **Bring leaders along:** Avoid surprises. As Leadership comes to certain conclusions, share those conclusions and decisions as they happen.
- **Share reasoning:** Explain the why, not just the what. Help people understand where this decision came from.
- **Share trade-offs:** Planning and prioritizing is essentially a game of trade-offs. Share a glimpse into some of these trade-offs, and why they were made.
- **Listen:** Make sure to genuinely listen to concerns and red flags. Though it may sound like complaining, the fact that people care is a good sign. Most times teams on the ground can identify major flaws in a plan much more quickly than Leadership.
- **Get people excited:** If you’re enthusiastic about the plan, help them see why. Give people a reason to get excited.

## **Common pitfalls at this stage:**

- **Skipping this step:** Leadership finalizes the plan before the Team leads have a chance to share feedback. This often leads to many flaws in the plan that could have been easily avoided.
- **Not being empathetic:** Many people will be surprised and often feel like their career trajectory will be impacted. Determine ahead of time who will need special attention and explanation, and put in the time to bring them along.
- **Not listening:** Leadership takes all feedback as criticism and doesn’t actually hear what people are saying. Most people want to do good, meaningful work — the least you can do is to hear them out.

Make adjustments based on feedback, close out the open questions, and put the final polish the plan. It’s normal for 5-10% of the plan to change at this stage. If things start to diverge, go back to Steps Two or Three.

With thoughtfulness and shared effort, the plan will come together and be ready to share with the entire company. This should be a moment of celebration. With the help of all of the leaders across the organization, and with all of the information at your disposal, you’ve come up with the best possible plan. Share the vision, the strategy, and the exciting projects ahead. Get your company pumped and raring to go.

## BRINGING IT ALL TOGETHER

A bad planning process is painful — but when it goes well, it can be a thing of beauty. Though planning is hard for many organizations, in our experience it's not as hard as most imagine it to be. **The key is to be clear about roles — who is responsible for what, when**. Align on this early and stick to it. The W Framework is our best attempt to solve this, and in our experience getting this one piece right is generally the difference between a bad planning process and a great one.

## **In summary, here is the full W Framework:**

**Step 1: Leadership provides context with Teams** _Goal_: Leadership delivers its perspective on what’s most important _Deliverable_: [Draft Strategic Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JI73WrGplrhNE46aLyRD_B74gEynI77EPgXn1ic6WeQ/edit?ref=review.firstround.com#), which should include:

- Mission
- Vision
- Goal
- A short narrative that explains the path to winning (aka, the Strategy)
- Three to five strategic “pillars” that describe the key bets that the company needs to make

**Step 2: Teams respond with a proposed plan** _Goal_: The Teams assemble their proposed plans for the year ahead _Deliverables_: [A plan for each Key Initiative](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RQWuvWDgcAv1ylksFXtiwhuTbHLcL1byIcoXsbCQfic/edit?ref=review.firstround.com#heading=h.c50sltibqqhp), which should include:

- Strategy
- List of key projects and timelines
- Expected impact and goals
- Resources required
- Risks and Dependencies

**Step 3: Leadership shares an integrated plan** _Goals_: Leadership integrates the many different plans into one company plan _Deliverables_: A cohesive [company plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JI73WrGplrhNE46aLyRD_B74gEynI77EPgXn1ic6WeQ/edit?ref=review.firstround.com#), which should include:

- Which strategies are being funded
- The expectations of those strategies in terms of goals and timelines
- The strategies that were cut and why

**Step 4: Teams confirm their buy-in** _Goals_: Ensure the Teams are bought in and ready to roll _Deliverables_:

- Feedback from the Teams
- Buy-in from the Teams
- A final plan that is shared widely with the company

Taken at one of my [all-time favorite Airbnb’s](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1114991) in Joshua Tree

The Buddha would have made an excellent product manager. He was obsessed with [solving people’s problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(Buddhism)), he summarized his ideas into [handy lists](https://www.insightmeditationcenter.org/books-articles/dhamma-lists/), and he developed simple [frameworks](https://tricycle.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Eightfold-Path-final-web-1024x614.png) for achieving his vision. He was also one of the earliest practitioners of [working from first principles](https://jamesclear.com/first-principles), famously sitting under a Bodhi tree for forty-nine days straight in order to “see things as they truly were.” 🧘‍♂️

Though it seems like [everyone](https://www.wired.com/2013/06/meditation-mindfulness-silicon-valley/) in tech is talking about mindfulness and meditation these days (occasionally [too much](https://qz.com/1489982/jack-dorsey-missed-the-point-of-meditation-on-his-myanmar-retreat/)), there’s a reason for this: [it](https://consultqd.clevelandclinic.org/evidence-based-mindfulness-what-science-tells-us-about-mindfulness-meditation-and-its-benefits/) [works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_on_meditation). As I’ve delved into the practice myself over the past year (a.k.a. just started to scratch the surface), the simple teachings have proven to be surprisingly valuable in my day-to-day life. **Below I look at** [**the three core teachings**](https://www.lionsroar.com/what-are-the-three-marks-of-existence/) **within Buddhism, and how I’ve applied them to my job as a product manager.** If any of the following resonates with you, I would encourage you to explore the ideas for yourself (see suggested reading at the end of this post).

> These truths are not presented in Buddhist teachings as dogmas demanding blind faith. Buddhists feel that these truths are universal and self-evident to anyone who cares to investigate in a proper way.
>
> — [Bhante Gunaratana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henepola_Gunaratana)

## 1\. There is suffering 😨

The Buddha’s core initial insight into human nature was that we are forever dissatisfied. We do not find lasting happiness or satisfaction in anything we experience, and thus we suffer. We think we’ll be happy when we finally get what we want (e.g. that title, that raise, that house), but we quickly feel unfulfilled and desire the next thing. This is referred to as [Dukkha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukkha).

> Anyone who has had even the briefest introduction to Buddhist teaching is familiar with its starting point: the inescapable truth that existence entails suffering.
>
> — [Jack Kornfield](https://jackkornfield.com/)

Why is this? According to [Robert Wright](https://robertwright.com/about/) in his recent [book about Buddhism](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MPZNG63/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1), dissatisfaction is rooted in our evolution. **Natural selection highly optimized us to spread our genes, NOT to be happy.** Seeking more status, more wealth, and more possessions helped us find more mates, and better mates. Our intuition makes us believe that we’ll be happy when we get these things, and for a bit we are, but it quickly (and always) fades. We forget how many times we’ve been disappointed by that short-lived satisfaction, and thus continue seeking. It’s a very pernicious illusion. It makes sense though — if we were fully satisfied with that one meal, that one tool, that one trip — we’d be dead meat.

When it comes to leading teams of people and building products for people, we live under a similar illusion. We think we can get to a place where everyone — our coworkers, our direct reports, our users — are happy. “I’ll solve that one problem and things will be OK again”. In truth that is rarely the case, and when it is, it doesn’t last. There will always be more problems, more challenges, and more “suffering”.

The key to reducing (and ending) suffering, for you and your team, is to accept that you won’t ever fully solve all of your problems. Fires will burn. People will get upset. Things will go wrong. This is the natural order of things. Recognize this, fix the problems, and keep moving forward. **Find your fulfillment in solving problems, not in forever keeping problems from arising.** If you want to explore this teaching further, start [here](https://www.lionsroar.com/what-is-suffering-10-buddhist-teachers-weigh-in/) and [here](https://www.lionsroar.com/the-buddha-taught-one-thing-only/).

> Suffering usually relates to wanting things to be different than they are. — [Allan Lokos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Lokos)

## 2\. All things are impermanent ❄️

So what is the source of suffering? According to Buddhism, **our unhappiness is rooted in a very simple misunderstanding about the world — believing that things last**. This is called [Anicca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impermanence). This misunderstanding leads us to cling to things that feel good (e.g. a great meal, a sweet new gadget, a promotion). We want them to last. When they invariably change or go away, we get sad. No matter how hard we hold on, everything (literally, EVERYTHING) changes, and eventually goes away. Buddha’s final words express this directly:

> Impermanence is inescapable. Everything vanishes.
>
> — Buddha

The solution is surprisingly simple (though not easy). Just let go. Let go of craving, of attachment, of desire. Recognize that all things are impermanent and that there’s no use in clinging. Fully appreciate the good times while they last, be present and in the moment, but when they change or go away, let them go. The following poem expresses the sentiment beautifully:

> He who binds to himself a joy
>
> Does the winged life destroy
>
> He who kisses the joy as it flies
>
> Lives in eternity’s sunrise
>
> — [William Blake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Blake)

For me, this teaching has been transformative both in work and in life. At Airbnb, as with every hyper-growth company, change is ever-present. With regular re-orgs, shifts in priorities, rotating team-members, etc., you are constantly in a state of flux. There are two ways to approach these changes. One, you could try to keep holding onto what you have, to fight it. Often this is very necessary and important. However, in many cases you’re fighting just to fight, or because you’re afraid of change. See if you can notice this next time something is about to change. In my experience, a better approach is to learn to become very comfortable with change. To recognize that change is part of life (and business). **Nothing, no matter how well it’s working, is going to last. Welcome change. Anticipate change. Use the change to your advantage. Appreciate the good times while they last, but don’t cling to anything.**

> Once we see that everything is impermanent and ungraspable and that we create a huge amount of suffering if we are attached to things staying the same, we realize that relaxing and letting go is a wiser way to live. Letting go does not mean not caring about things. It means caring about them in a flexible and wise way.
>
> — [Jack Kornfield](https://jackkornfield.com/)

This teaching can apply to changes from the outside, as well as from the inside. **Often times the hardest things to let go of are _our own_ ideas/products/strategies.** We identify with them, and we get attached to them. That is exactly the problem. Early in my PM career I felt that when I owned a product, it was my job to make sure it survived, no matter what. It took a long time for me to learn this is completely wrong — your job is to help accelerate the good ideas, and kill the bad ideas. The longer you keep a bad idea alive, even if you were tasked with making it work, the worse it’ll be for both you and the business.

’s [recent podcast](https://player.fm/series/below-the-line-with-james-beshara), around the 31:00 mark. You can learn more about the teaching of impermanence [here](https://www.insightmeditationcenter.org/books-articles/articles/impermanence/) and [here](https://beherenownetwork.com/joseph-goldstein-ep-49-truth-of-impermanence/).

> All human unhappiness comes from not facing reality squarely, exactly as it is. — Buddha

## 3\. There is no lasting self ⛄️

A third foundational teaching of Buddhism is that there is no lasting “self”. This is referred to as [Anatta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatta). According to the teaching, which is actually supported by [recent](https://qz.com/506229/neuroscience-backs-up-the-buddhist-belief-that-the-self-isnt-constant-but-ever-changing/) [scientific](https://www.livescience.com/55999-is-your-self-just-an-illusion.html) [research](https://bigthink.com/ideafeed/good-news-science-buddha-agree-theres-no-you), the sense that there’s an unchanging and lasting “me” inside our bodies from birth to death, is an illusion. Your identity and ego are constructs of your brain. The sense of control you have over your actions is similarly a construct. We see ourselves as the CEO of our lives, when we’re actually the observers. These constructs are very helpful for our lives, they help us be productive in the world, but that doesn’t make them real.

> To understand not-self, you have to meditate. If you only intellectualize, your head will explode.
>
> — [Ajahn Chah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajahn_Chah)

As the quote above so eloquently puts it, this is a tricky teaching to fully grasp. Advanced meditators experientially feel this teaching, and I’ve felt glimmers of it in my own meditation practice, but the idea itself is powerful even if you haven’t personally felt it.

For me, this teaching has been a valuable reminder to always keep my own ego in check. As a PM, you’re often the default choice to present your team’s work and the first to get credit when things go well. In my experience, whenever I’ve instead given those opportunities to other team members, or deflected credit, the team and its efficacy has gotten stronger. **Though we all know that the most effective leaders place the team above themselves, we forget this in practice, especially when our ego has a chance to shine.**

This same idea is echoed in one of the most important business books of all time, [Good to Great](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058DRUV6/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1), which looked at over a thousand companies to understand what distinguishes so-called “good” companies from “great” ones. What the [data showed](https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/level-five-leadership.html) was that the most successful companies were led by leaders whose “ambition is first and foremost for the cause, for the organization and its purpose, not themselves.” This is what [Jim Collins](https://www.jimcollins.com/) called a Level 5 Leader. At the risk of your head exploding 🤯, if you want to learn more about this buddhist teaching, check out [this](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/various/wheel202.html) and [this](https://samharris.org/the-illusion-of-the-self2/).

> According to the teaching of the Buddha, the idea of self is an imaginary, false belief which has no corresponding reality. \[It\] is the source of all the troubles in the world from personal conflicts to wars between nations. In short, to this false view can be traced all the evil in the world.

# What it feels like when you've found product-market fit — by Lenny Rachitsky

## Stories from the founders of Netflix, Uber, Airbnb, Substack, Stripe, Datadog, GitHub, Segment, Dropbox, Superhuman, Instacart, Nextdoor, and many more

[![Lenny Rachitsky](https://ph-avatars.imgix.net/478540/94ce686a-08a7-48d4-8e1c-f8c8ca6588e0.jpeg?auto=compress&codec=mozjpeg&cs=strip&auto=format&w=32&h=32&fit=crop&frame=1)](https://www.producthunt.com/@lenny_rachitsky)

![](https://ph-files.imgix.net/966c62f3-fdd7-495c-a825-0561525c1788.png?auto=compress&codec=mozjpeg&cs=strip&auto=format&fit=max&frame=1)

[_Lenny Rachitsky_](https://www.producthunt.com/@lenny_rachitsky) _is a writer, angel investor and adviser. He writes a weekly product and growth_ [_newsletter_](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/) _on Substack. Find him on Twitter:_ [_@lennysan_](https://twitter.com/lennysan).

## Q: How do I know if my product is working? What does it feel like when you’ve found “product-market fit”?

_“When we hit PMF, we started feeling pull for the first time”_

_“Like getting pressed into the back of your seat by a fast car or a plane taking off”_

_“Word of mouth was uncontrollable”_

_“Why won't you take my money???”_

_“Yeah, you really can't miss it”_

This is what you hear from successful founders when you ask them what product-market fit felt like. But is this always what it feels like? I wanted to find out.

**Over the past few months I reached out to founders of the twenty five most iconic companies I could get a hold of and asked them one question:**

**_When did you first know you found product-market fit?_** _Whatever that point means to you – was there something you noticed, felt, or experienced where you were like “Damn, I think we got something here!”_

After collecting and reviewing their stories (all of which you’ll find below), one thing became clear: every company _did_ have a clear moment where they recognized they had PMF, and many _did_ experience a sudden hard-to-miss pull from the market, BUT many companies _did not_ see it immediately. For many companies, PMF became clear over time through a series of compounding wins or milestones. Here’s how it broke down across the companies I looked at:

![](https://ph-files.imgix.net/ae065374-d5da-4365-a5d9-10fefbdaf27c.png?auto=format&auto=compress&codec=mozjpeg&cs=strip)

### **Some of my biggest takeaways from these stories:**

**1\. Market “pull” comes in many forms:**

- An inflection in organic growth
- Customers asking to pay for the product before you ask
- Users flip from being excited about what you have to mad about what you don’t have
- Customers complaining when your site goes down
- People using the product even when it’s broken

**2\. About half of these companies found PMF immediately after launch, but half spent months or years iterating to get there:**

- Netflix: 18 months
- Segment: 1.5 years
- Airbnb: 2 years
- PagerDuty: 2 years
- Superhuman: 3 years
- Amplitude: 4 years

Once they got there though, it became obvious.

**3\. The intensity of the pull is a factor of the** _**fit**_ **(how good your product is at solving the user’s problem) AND** _**initial market size**_ **(is it niche or broad).** Dropbox, Netflix, and Tinder were 10x better products within a huge market —> sudden and broad pull. Instacart, Superhuman, and Substack were 10x better products but for a narrow set of initial customers —> steady and compounding pull.

### What is Product-Market fit anyway?

I covered this in [a previous post](https://www.lennyrachitsky.com/p/how-to-know-if-youve-got-productmarket), and I want to make clear that getting to a feeling of PMF does not mean you’ll automatically be able to build a successful business. There are three things you have to get right to find **True Product-Market Fit**:

1. Make a product that people want — that’s what this post is all about.
2. Make a profit delivering this product to people at scale — companies like [Cherry](https://techcrunch.com/2012/12/23/cherry-car-wash-shut-down/), [Luxe](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2017/04/27/valet-startup-luxe-shuts-down-its-door-to-door.html), and [Exec](https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/10/rip-lazy-times/) are valuable cautionary tales.
3. Find and keep these people, sustainably — [check out this previous post](https://www.lennyrachitsky.com/p/how-to-know-if-youve-got-productmarket) that covers the quantitative side of PMF, like retention and sales yield.

Of these three milestones though, the most likely to kill your business is the first: not building something people want. And that what this post focuses on — **how do you know when you’ve built something people want**? Below you’ll find stories from twenty-five companies — many of which have never been shared before — revealing the moment they realized they had something special.

## Sign 1: 🔥 Sudden and significant pull from the market

“For me there was a visceral sense of your thing taking on a life of its own and lurching forward, **like getting pressed into the back of your seat by a fast car or a plane taking off**. The most standout moment for me was our demo video hitting the top of Digg (and then Reddit).”

“With apologies to Justice Potter Stewart, I’ve often felt that Product Market Fit is not unlike hard core pornography: hard to define, but you know it when you see it. **It took us at Netflix 18 months to finally find the repeatable scalable business model that worked**.

As you know, I called my book "That Will Never Work" because everyone I pitched that original idea had that reaction. (Including my wife!). But they were right. The original idea didn’t work. But hundreds of failed experiments later, and after many a sleepless night of worrying, we finally tested the unlikely combination of No Due Dates, No Late Fees, and Subscription that ultimately was the thing that ended up working. And boy did it work. **Within days of testing it we knew we had a winner.**

**Where before we were struggling to get traffic, all of sudden we couldn’t keep up. Our previously prodigious amounts of inventory were suddenly not enough. Engagement soared, churn went dramatically down. Everything started working!**

If there was a moment when Netflix stopped being a start up and became a real company, it was then.”

“Uber never really had a product market fit problem — **zero marketing budget and we were growing like a weed. Word of mouth was uncontrollable**, and especially as regulatory heat started it's all anyone could talk about (is how it felt). Marketing was free because media loved the story.”

“Besides any gut feeling or friend input, I’d say we knew **we had PMF towards the end of December 2012 when downloads started to pick up. By early to mid January 2013 those downloads started to skyrocket**.

The rise of Tinder was really fast and there were very, very few changes to the product before it had already taken off. The swipe had been added within weeks of launching in August or September 2012. I think we were working on the 2.0 of the app already before we rose but it wasn’t finished or released until we were already spreading like wildfire.”

“The biggest difference between our ideas pre-PMF vs. when we found **it was this feeling of** _**pull**_. Before we had any sort of fit, it always felt like we had to push our ideas on other people. We had to nag people to use the product.

**When we hit PMF, we started feeling 'pull' for the first time**. We solved one problem for people... so they started asking us to solve a second, third, fourth, and fifth. Most of our early product iteration was just responding to customer requests.”

“What indicated to us that there was something interesting here was that our friends who were using it asked if they could invite their friends, and those people invited their friends, and it **spread through word of mouth process.**

**We just put up a wait list on our site and demand took off, over a couple months we had a huge wait list. We weren’t expecting it.**”

“For Patreon, it was actually right after we launched with Jack's music video on YouTube video and patrons and creators started writing in.

https://youtu.be/mZ02alEkbLw

**I'd never seen that level of passion and immediate resonance**, and our launch was particularly fraught with stress since weeks before all the creators that were asked to launch rejected us. I actually emailed investors right after this, with a now cringey-esque note: ‘If you recall anything about me, I'm not one to exaggerate or overstate things, but based on the results and response thus far, I really think this company is going to be the one.’”

“About six months after we launched we changed our phone provider I think to DialPad or RingCentral. We misconfigured the system and for some reason after it prompted the user to "Press #1 for Sales" and the user pressed the button, it would just hang up on the caller. We didn't know about it for three weeks because we were just trying to fill the non-phone orders.

The way we found out was a prospect was able to contact us through chat support and wrote **"I've been trying to get to your sales people for weeks and you keep hanging up on me!!! Why won't you take my money???" That's what product market fit feels like.**”

“When we launched our private beta (mostly enthusiasts from the Ruby community) we were offering it for free. **To our surprise, users started writing to us asking ‘Can we pay for this??’ They liked it so much they wanted to pay for it. That was the first sign this was going to work**.

Our early users were individuals from the Ruby community. These people already demonstrated they were willing to operate on the cutting edge, Ruby was really new still in 2009. It was critical that we were embedded in that community before then, I don’t think we’d be able to convince people to try GitHub otherwise.

**After we got traction with individuals we were able to expand into SMBs, and then enterprises**.”

“I remember distinctly it was a Friday night. We had been working on the wait list in preparation for our press launch, which would have been, I think, the following Wednesday or Thursday. Everyone goes home, and I wake up Saturday morning, and I open up Google Analytics, and I see something like **600 concurrents on our site**, which nobody knew about at that point. I was just like, ‘What's going on? This is not normal. Something must be wrong. Right?’

**I'm just screenshotting the page; I'm calling my parents saying, "Oh, this is crazy. It might actually be working."** And up until that point, we never really had an idea of what success, at least in the consumer space, was like. That was sort of the first moment where we built something that actually worked.

We ended up getting 10,000 sign-ups that first day, over 50,000 the first week, and almost 1 million in the first year.”

## Sign 2: 🎢 Steady and compounding pull from the market

“Early on I had product-market fit anxiety. Do we have it? How will we know? There isn't really a moment I can point to where that changed. We've just been growing fairly consistently, and gradually the how-do-we-keep-up anxiety got bigger and bigger **until there wasn't time left in the day to worry about whether we had product-market fit**.

We did have retention curves that looked pretty good from early on, especially for paying readers, and writers with paying readers.

" **We found pockets of PMF with specific segments of founders, managers, executives and business development professionals**. Once we recognized this, we were able to focus the entire company on serving that narrow segment better than anybody else. It’s a commonly held view that tailoring the product too narrowly to a smaller target market means that growth will hit a ceiling — but I don’t think that’s the case.

The biggest specific moment of realizing we had PMF though actually occurred just when I had arrived at a conference. Before I'd left, I'd asked our Head of Growth to update all our analytics. **What we saw was that every single metric was amazing** — growth, DAU/MAU, PMF score, NPS, virality, CAC payback, CAC:LTV, activation rates, long-term retention rates, and so on. That was when I realized that I could put together a series B deck that would raise an awesome round. And so I did!

Just a month later Superhuman was on the front page of the New York Times, in the Economist, and in the Guardian.”

“ **For Instacart, product-market fit happened across a series of moments**. we found product-market fit very early on with people who wanted groceries delivered as soon as possible and didn’t care which store they came from. **This made us feel like we had achieved product-market fit but it was only with a small sub-segment of customers**.

The average customer wanted to shop from their favorite grocery store. So, we formed partnerships with top retailers. As a result, customers started to seek us out and word of mouth grew. We then signed more partnerships, reached a larger scale with customers, and in turn attracted more partners.

Ultimately we created a marketplace where most customers can shop from their favorite stores, and as a result, customers have a great experience using Instacart and want to share it with their family and friends.

**Initial signs of product-market fit feel a bit like a calm breeze, while true product-market fit feels like a powerful wind at your back, accelerating you forward and compounding over time.**”

“I distinctly remember one day when I thought we had reached product-market fit. We only had about ten neighborhoods using Nextdoor at the time. One of our engineers needed to upgrade the database which required taking the service offline for about an hour. As a lean team, he decided to start the migration (and make Nextdoor unavailable) around lunchtime in the middle of the week. We thought no one would notice the downtime since we had less than a few hundred users at the time.

**About ten minutes after taking the servers offline, I started getting emails and phone calls from concerned users. What happened to Nextdoor? One user called me in a panic because she needed to contact a neighbor immediately and the directory on Nextdoor was unavailable.** Another user was worried that the service was suddenly gone and he was trying to organize a neighborhood meeting that night to save a local park. We rushed back from our lunch break to get the servers back online as soon as possible. It was an embarrassing mistake to take the service down mid-day without any advanced notice. But the good news was we had clearly built something that mattered in the lives of users – they noticed within minutes when the service was unavailable.

**If your users are urgently calling and demanding access to your product, you have clearly built something of real value. That’s product-market fit.**”

“ **We didn't have a sudden influx of new users, but from the moment we flipped from closed to open beta, we started seeing a regular influx of sign-ups**, and as we added key features (such as alerting!), we saw them use our product more and more actively. This constant influx of new users has grown ever since then..”

“I can't recall a specific moment in time when it clicked and we said we had product-market fit. Instead, **it was more of a transition where our confidence that we had reached PMF grew over time**.

We launched the beta version of PagerDuty in the summer of 2009 and the paid version in Dec 2009. That early version was very much an MVP oriented around alerting; it didn't even have the concept of incidents and incident tracking where you could track multiple incidents (issues) broken at the same time. We quickly realized that and added the concept of incident tracking in early 2010.

Throughout 2010 and 2011, we saw exponential month over month growth... if I remember correctly >10% month over month growth in 2011. (Keep in mind, that growth was on a small base... I believe we hit $1m in ARR sometime in 2011) **. By the middle of 2011, we felt pretty confident we had product-market fit, as we were solving a real hair on fire problem with the platform** (namely, ensure critical issues were handled quickly and no critical issue would fall through the cracks and impact customers and the business for an extended period of time) and seeing that consistent exponential month-over-month growth.”

“We had about 10 customers pre-launch (about 12 months of selling before launching), and we got them all through founder based selling & our networks. So I wouldn't say we had product-market fit yet. **Although we knew something was there, we didn't yet know if this was a mainstream buyer or a niche**.

For a little background, these customers were not your typical analytics software buyer & they weren’t already buying any other analytics tools at the time (data warehouses or BI tools). They were engineers who were stuck doing data projects for the business. They were developers at the core and gravitated to Looker because it was a developer oriented/code-based way to do analytics in the backend, with a frontend that any business user could use.

So over the 5ish months after launch two things happened that created our opportunity to be the next generation BI tool in the market — **our fit happened because the market shifted**:

1. It turned out that there was a whole new generation of product/data people within companies who, once exposed to Looker, had the same revelations as our early engineering buyers
2. AWS launched a new class of data warehousing in the cloud called Redshift. This was the first time data warehouses were easily accessible & consumable, and became AWS's fast growing service ever. From there it was clear that the data landscape was changing we had the perfect fit for it.”

“As a founding team, we are pretty self-critical and tend to focus on how we can improve things for customers, or what's broken and how to fix it. So I think I only realized it 2-3 years after it happened. **In retrospect though, a pretty good sign for PMF was when in spite of the obvious gaps in our marketing, product and care, we saw consistently high NPS (80+), low churn, and record high MoM organic growth.**”

“Traction is one indication of product-market fit but there’s nothing like seeing your product being used in the wild. **I distinctly remember walking into Philz one day overhearing a small group of friends talking about Product Hunt and their upcoming launch. I teared up**. As founders, we spend so much effort building and hoping people love what we’ve created. Seeing a stranger use what we’ve built unprompted might seem trivial but it’s an impactful moment for myself and many others.”

“At Amplitude, Product Market Fit happened when we transitioned from focusing on _Mobile Analytics_ to focusing on _Product Analytics_ — building analytics for product teams.

It was a pretty nerve wracking experience to shift our sales, marketing, and product strategy to focus on the needs of Product teams — I definitely questioned whether it was a justified risk given the traction we had already been seeing. That year we held our first conference called Amplify, the entire agenda was geared towards Product teams, and so many people showed up we had to open extra sections of the venue and have people standing at the back. >1,000 people from Product teams around the world showed up. **While I was in line to get my pass I heard a whole team from a large bank talking together - someone said ‘I’ve been in Product for 10 years and this is the first time a company has ever focussed on us’.**

**That’s when I knew we’d found PMF.**

TRANSCRIPT
============================================================

The scaling laws have been remarkably robust. There's a lot we don't know yet in terms of the vulnerability of these systems. If you don't need to buy the Galacticos, why do you have, like, an Andrew Tullock, a Daniel Gross, an Alex Wang, and the Galactica's assembling. If I give you $10,000,000,000, what would you spend it on first? Knowing what you know, what do you not let your children do? This is 20 v c with me, Harry Stebbings. And, today, we have one of the leading minds in AI, Joelle Pinault on the show. Joelle is the chief scientist at Cohere where she leads research on advancing large language models and practical AI systems. Before joining Cohere, she was VP of AI research at Meta, where she founded and led Meta's AI Montreal lab. Joelle is also a professor at McGill University and renowned for her pioneering work in reinforcement learning robotics and responsible AI development. But before we dive into the show today, are you drowning in AI tools? ChatGPT for writing, Notion for docs, Gmail for email, Slack for comms, and you're constantly copy pasting between them all losing context and losing time?

Joelle, it is so great to have you in the studio. I've heard many great things from Mick Aden Schrep. So thank you so much for joining me. Thank you. Happy to be here. Now you spent over six years at Meta, and I wanna start there because it's a very transformative time and place. What are the biggest takeaways for you from that time, and how did that shape your mindset to how you think today? Well, I was there from 2017 to 2025, and you have to see just how much AI changed over that period of time. What we were really focused on is fundamental AI research. One thing that I've learned is just sometimes how long it takes to prove out a hypothesis. We feel like AI is moving at the speed of lightning. But in fact, there's some things that it just takes a few years to mature, to get the right optimizer, the right compute, the right data for that to really make a difference. I look at where we are today, and everyone kind of goes, it's here. It's here. It's here. Yeah. And then you actually look at what a lot of the leaders have been saying recently where it's like, actually, Andre was saying, it's not the year of the agents. It's the decade of agents. Sam's kinda pulling back too. Have we got over our skis and we're actually kind of all pulling back realizing that time is the fact that we need to rely on? Well, I'll give you an example. You know, I've been in research for for a couple decades now. I've been working on reinforcement learning for over twenty years. And suddenly, everyone's talking about reinforcement learning, you know, since the advent of reasoning models, agents, and so on. So, So, you know, sometimes you have to be a little patient with these ideas. And the right algorithmic tweak, the right context, the right problem domains just opens up the magic. I I was listening to Andre yesterday and he said in the show that reinforcement learning is terrible. Less terrible than twenty years ago. Have we over invested in RL based methods at the expense of maybe, like, more scalable alternatives? Oh, I'm still super bullish on RL in that, like, the concept itself is so fundamental. You know, this idea of training through a system of rewards of indicating what's valuable and what's not valuable through numerical values, like, that is so fundamental. It's not going away. Now, you know, where we're maybe getting a little bit ahead is thinking that just RL out of the box is gonna give us AGI. That part, a lot less so. You know, if you look at the curve of progress, RL is terribly inefficient. And so the amount of signal you need to get in order to really shape the behavior of a model is far from where we are today. And so we'll need to figure out how to to really deal with this with this learning efficiency problem. You're probably thinking, what did I get myself in for? And I don't blame you. I ask questions that I think everyone else thinks, but I'm not afraid to say. I don't know. Why is RL so inefficient? There's a few reasons. You're gonna get me on like a This is getting a really lovely job. There's a there's a few reasons. One is the fact that RL is about sequential decision making. So, you know, think about you're starting at a point, you need to figure out what you're gonna do next, and you might pick the right side of the branch or the wrong side of the branch. And then, like, the road keeps on splitting. So every time you make a mistake, it sort of compounds through the length of the series of actions you're making. So that means, like, the amount of error you can make can be very, very large, and to get it right is quite difficult. Sometimes people compare it to, like, a needle in a haystack is, like, finding the right solution in RL. So there's that part. The other part that's hard is the fact that to train the system, to train the models, you have to essentially take actions to learn. You can't learn from static data. You can learn some things from static data, but actually, to get the right policy, you need to test it out. And so that means you need a simulator. You need to get the synthetic data. All of that can be really expensive also. And so we have difficulty getting, like, just a variety of environments in simulation to test RL. When we look at the cost curve for RL, you see the RL. When we look at the cost curve for RL, you said you've been working on it for twenty years. Yeah. Have we seen that dramatically come down? Will we see it continue to dramatically come down? Or is it a case of it is just a fundamentally expensive method of training? It's coming down especially in domains where we have good reward functions. So the place where most people started hearing about RL is around the AlphaGo time. You know, the game of Go, which was sort of one of the goals for AI. Many people thought we were at that time, we were still a decade away from being able to have machines play Go at the level of humans. And and out comes a team from DeepMind, you know, goes off and plays against the world champion and shows that that RL can basically do it. And so I would say in cases where we clearly know what's the goal, we can write down precisely the reward function, we're good. We can make a ton of progress. So that's why you're seeing progress in mathematics, very well defined reasoning tasks, names, these kinds of things. RL, to shape the behavior of models to get them to be social creatures, that we have no idea how to do. I mean, I don't know if you have children, but, like, shaping their behaviors, you know, the number of times you can repeat the same thing and still they do something else. And so there's something there. You don't know how to write that out mathematically. And that's where I think we're still in for for some hard work. So when we look at the training versus the inference market today, we've had so much weight on training so far, and it's been incredibly costly and expensive. And then I hear everyone say, well, actually, inference is 95% of the market, and that's where it's all going. And that's where NVIDIA will make most of their money. How do we think about the cost curve applied to training versus inference and I think there's a lot of different variants and, you know, if you'll allow, maybe I'll pivot to, like, you know anywhere. Where I'm where I'm going with Cohere now. Just, you know, I joined Cohere less a month ago. Super exciting company. I think one of the things that Cohere is doing is actually to develop AI models that run on premise. So that means enterprise bring it in. They run it locally. So the company has to worry about the training of the models. Obviously, we want world class models for the needs of enterprise. Doesn't have to worry about the inference. Doesn't have to worry about the inference cost. The the, you know, the the clients' customers have to figure out what's the right way for them to digest the AI. That means, like, there's a lot of motivation to have very efficient models so that they can run really efficiently on premise. So, you know, we get caught up into one one paradigm, but there are other paradigms as well. If they're the ones paying for the inference, is there not less incentive to make them efficient? Because, sod it, you're not the one paying for it. If you're the one paying for the inference costs, god, I want it to be as efficient as possible because it's my dollar going to that. But if it's IBM's dollar, yeah, I would love it to be efficient, but we're not paying for it. We're still in the early days of AI adoption in enterprise. So what's good for the client is good for us. Totally totally get you. What's the biggest challenge about capital efficient AI today? I know that sounds strange. When you look at the economics, so to speak, what's the biggest challenge? There's a lot of challenge today, I think, in terms of the economics of AI. I think one of the biggest challenge, the fact that it's very very hard to have predictability. Right? Everyone wants to know when are we going to hit the breakthrough. Everyone wants to know how many GPUs do I actually need. Everyone wants to know, like, what's the return I can expect. There's just a lot of uncertainty built into the system. A lot of that is because there's a lot we don't know about this technology. And so that means we have to take in quite a bit of risk when you're building out, whether you're building out your data center, whether you're building out your workforce, whether you're trying to figure out, you know, how much much data to to curate. And so that makes it difficult for a lot of people. People want answers. And this is a world where we don't have that level of predictability compared to other industries. Does progression happen in kind of a linear fashion, Or does it happen in step functions like AlphaGo, like a DeepSeek, which depending on kind of what you believe, suggests a lot of efficiency in terms of model improvement. Is it step function or is it linear? I tend to decompose different ingredients that lead to progress. You know, people often talk about, like, the algorithms, the data, the compute. I think in general, compute and data have a more linear effect on progress. You build more compute. You run bigger models. You can typically get better performance. You feed in more data. It's not just quantity. You need to worry about quality and diversity as well, but roughly, it's more linear ish with respect to the data. The algorithms are the ones that have the nonlinear effect. And so you can explore lots of ideas, and then something like the transformer comes along and just changes the paradigm. And it's not just your transformer. You know? On the optimization side, suddenly we hit upon Adam, which is a technique to to do the optimization of your model, changes in the paradigm. Reasoning, suddenly, we start thinking about how to put that in the loop reasoning, and it changed the paradigm. So those ideas tend to have a nonlinear effect. The challenge with these algorithmic ideas, though, is that actually, it may take a long time to prove themselves out. So, like, the paper can be sitting out there. There's thousands of papers coming out. The idea is sitting out there, and we may not think to try it with the right data at the right scale, with the right combination of hyperparameters. And so you don't notice that effect for a while. So it's hard to predict and it's nonlinear, more on the algorithmic side than I think on whether it's data compute, even talent or other things. With respect to Google, I mean, transformers obviously birthed in Google and sat as papers for many, a couple of years. When we, you mentioned that you compute algorithms, data. If we just kind of go through them to understand, everyone suggests that it's weird, there's two different worlds. Like scaling laws exist, just throw more compute at it when you look at data center investment, when you look at all desirability of compute. And then again, you have GPT five seemingly focusing on efficiency and other signals. Do scaling laws play out from here? And if so, for how long? The scaling laws have been remarkably robust. They don't play exactly as we expect, but still, they've been remarkably robust. Lots of people have bet against scaling laws in the past. And I would say overall, you know, we've seen a pretty robust effect. They don't work alone. We also need these algorithmic innovations. But most of the time, you know, I I wouldn't bet against it. On the algorithm side, is that the hardest to innovate on? You could think about, but you can buy more compute, might be hard, but you can buy more compute and data. There are different ways, whether it's synthetic or human. Is algorithms the hardest to innovate on? It's certainly the most creative work to be done. And, you know, the space of ideas is so wide, that I would say it's hardest in the sense that, like, you can move in, you know, I'm a researcher at heart. You can move in so many different directions and picking the right one, you don't know till you get there, whether it was the right one or not. It's a little bit like reinforcement learning. So in that sense, I think it's it's the most interesting one, it's the most frustrating one, and it's the most frustrating one, and it's the most difficult one, certainly from investors' point of view, to know where to put your chips. Is it speaking of kind of knowing where to put your chips and moving from purely a research lens with with matter Yeah. To now also building product Yes. Is there ever this, like, inherent conflict between intellectually interesting research with the need to productize and monetize? And how do you think about that? I mean, one of the reasons I'm really excited to be joining Cohere actually is because, like, we're at a stage where AI is really starting to be useful. Maybe not as useful as people think it is, but we are there. And by working on AI that's going into enterprise, I feel we're gonna get such an interesting signal of what works and what doesn't work. You know, we keep on talking about, you know, AGI and AI for the masses and so on. But, actually, like, when you need to sell AI to a business, you get a real signal of what works, what doesn't work. And that's what I'm most curious to see. And, you know, we've been using these academic benchmarks for many years. You get some signal, but it's not the same as as, you know, curious to learn out of that. You know, we're gonna get new types of data. We're gonna get, I think, a lot of insights that are then going to drive the research ideas. I think that's that's the other thing to think through when you have a large space of ideas to explore. Getting that feedback signal from the real world is super useful to guide you through that search of ideas. I just had a great chat to David Khan at Sequoia who said that he thinks a good barometer for utility value within enterprises is like, does it have the ability to replace the work of your bottom 5% in any category? He says, like, we overestimate a lot. Yeah. Can it replace the bottom 5% in any function? And if it can, that's a very meaningful improvement. Do you think that's a good barometer? And how would you advise an enterprise on whether something's useful or not as a yardstick? You know, I I prefer in terms of a barometer of productivity something a little bit different, which is to say, can most of your employees do 10 x the amount of work with AI versus on their own? That to me is actually a better barometer. I think human AI have very complementary abilities. So to just, like, flat out replace a portion of your workforce is actually pretty unrealistic. Some may some may try and some may be slowing down their hiring, but I actually think actually, I think 10 x ing your work feels more on is that is that not a bigger ask? I'm almost more intimidated by 10 x ing my work. Oh, I don't think that's unrealistic at all. Wow. Yeah. In a timeline that is next couple of years? Yes. I'm sorry. How how does that actually shape out then? I think you have to identify very concretely the types of work that you are delivering, But I think we're starting to see, like, you know, Hollywood quality productions being made in a matter of hours. We are seeing, you know, to take a super concrete case like machine translation, if humans are doing the machine translation compared to machines doing it, you go from hours to seconds on long form text, multi page documents. And so for a lot of work, it's not like AI can do all of the work. Humans still need to ask the right question. They need to verify the information. They need to shape the task. But once the task is well defined, the product are clear, like, all the design considerations are fed into the prompt, you press the button and you've got an answer in seconds for something that used to take sometimes weeks and months. I'm just kind of trying to reevaluate a belief that I had for the last few months, which is, like, for I'm a venture investor for a sin. For all of us to make money Mhmm. We need to see the transition from kind of human labor budgets to AI spend. And it's with that transition where we obviously see the TAM massively increase, and we make a lot of money. But when I hear you say that, I suddenly question that assumption as, like, the barometer for whether we make money because you're suggesting that actually we don't replace the human labor budget. It just makes us 10 x more efficient. Is that correct? Yes. You know, there's a lot of nuance to all of that, and some work will be harder to get that same level of efficiency gain, whereas other work, you'll see a 100 x in terms of efficiency gain. But I I do think that for a lot of the work that's happening right now, that's absolutely feasible. Where do you think I'm sorry. Where is the efficiency gains most tangible? It goes back a little bit to this notion of what are the tasks that we can specify well. In any case where we can be very precise about what a great result looks like, we'll be able to make that task automatic much more easily than tasks that are much more nuanced and and have a lot of complexity. So it's ambiguity? Ambiguity in the specification of the task is what's hard for our machines. How have you seen enterprise reaction to this? There's fear from workers sometimes. There's excitement from leaders. There's apathy sometimes. Mhmm. How have you seen and measured enterprise response? A lot of the the workforce can be reasonably fearful about job displacement. There's a lot of also individuals who have, you know, a bit of an instinctive reaction to to change. And and change can be hard for a lot of people, and we're seeing a lot of change in a very short time span. And so I think there's also a generational effect. I think for some generations, there's that change is is more more jarring. I think for the younger generations, I have teenagers, young adults at home for them. Yeah. It's just native. They just, you know, kind of, you know, are gonna grow up with that technology in a different way than than some of the older generations. It's interesting. Sam speaking kind of children there at home and how they engage with it. You know, Sam Altman said that kind of young people engage with it as like an OS to the world and AI is that companion for them and then older people kind of use it as a next gen Google. Do you agree with that? And do you see that in your work? I see a lot of people using it as a tool more than as a as a companion. People have this, you know, Swiss knife in their in their work life all of a sudden that can be super helpful, but that's really most of what I see. What are enterprises biggest challenges with AI adoption at scale? You know, one of the challenges is to make sure that the AI comes in and can be integrated in their workflows, their processes, their information. And so the challenge is to deploy in a way that allows them to exploit all of the information systems that they already have, and some of them have accumulated these over decades. That's, you know, some of the work that that remains to be done of figuring out how to do that. Existing systems and data flows. I and that's, you know, of course, that's something we see a lot of cohere because we do on premise deployment. You know, one of the things we focus on the most is data confidentiality and security so that so that enterprise can exploit all of that information. So that's top of mind for us. But it's also a huge opportunity, I would say. There's a there's a big interest compatibility, I think, is a is a challenge. In many cases, for people change is hardest for people, and so you have to get them curious about using the technology. Many people feel they have to get it right the first time, and and I really think, like, a spirit of exploration and curiosity is is much better suited to to the phase of maturity of the technology that we have today. We don't have all the answers of how it should be used. That's gonna come from from people on the field. Security is a topic that we quite often glaze over, especially when in, investing in kind of application layer AI tools. What does no one know about AI security that people should know? With respect to AI security, I think there's a new front that's opening up with the development of agents. And frankly, there's a lot we don't know yet in terms of the vulnerability of these systems. With LLMs, we're starting to get a better understanding. We've had, you know, quite a bit of red teaming exercise and jailbreaking and so on. And so people have identified different risk vectors, prompt injections, things like that, which are vectors for malicious actors to interfere with a system. With AI agents, we haven't seen that. And one of the features of computer security in general is often, you know, it's a bit of a cat and mouse game, quite frankly. Like, there's a lot of ingenuity in terms of breaking into systems, and then you need a lot of ingenuity in terms of building defenses. And so we just have to stay very active in that sense. What are the potential vulnerabilities though in an agent world? In terms of agents, you know, we we worry a lot about, hallucinations in LLMs. The parallel in agents is impersonation. So agents that come along and are essentially impersonating entities, which they don't legitimately represent. And in doing so, taking actions on the behalf of these entities where they don't legitimately represent, whether it's, infiltrating, you know, banking systems and and so on. And so I I do think we have to be quite lucid about this, develop standards towards the develop ways to to test for that in a very rigorous way. There's ways to reduce that risk drastically. You run your agent, you know, completely cut off from the web. You're reducing your risk exposure significantly, but then you lose access to some information. So depending on depending on your use case, depending on what you actually need, there's different solutions that may be appropriate. That's a really hard one because, like, then verification becomes the most important thing. Mhmm. But then it's like, who's the arbiter of verification? Is it governments? Is it is it companies? How does one think about that? Who says you're a valid agent versus an invalid agent? Governments can be good for defining standards on which we all agree. Companies are much better at building the solutions at scale and deploying them. Do you think governments are good at setting the standards when you look at AI and where we're at? And then when you look at the sophistication levels of government programs or decision makers, with respect, they're just a little bit behind. Do you think they are actually equipped? I don't think you should look at where government are in terms of necessarily AI regulation. That AI as a field is so incredibly young and fast moving and and by nature, and there's some good in this. Governments are moving a little bit more cautiously and and and usually need to benefit from our knowledge to make good policies. And so I I do think you you can look at other fields in terms of of regulation. You know, you look at aviation, The security record for aviation today compared to where we were fifty years ago is just incredible. And governments have played a role in defining that in terms of standards and in terms of what are the the norms and so on. So I'm quite hopeful. I'm an optimist about this. Maybe it's my Canadian side, that governments can play a useful role. In many cases, you know, clear standards actually means reducing uncertainty for a lot of companies in this space. But we shouldn't expect uncertainty for a lot of companies in this space, but we shouldn't expect that to be ahead of the technology. I think that would be the wrong order of things. In some sense, we need to develop that technology with enough of a creative space, and we need to learn fast and then develop the right the right guardrails for that technology from from from the real earnings we have. We we mentioned that kind of, governments and their role. But when I had Nick on the show, he was saying actually the benefits of not being an American company, given some geopolitical challenges sometimes. I'm just intrigued. Do you think we will have these kind of sovereign models for each geo? You know, we have Mistral in France, you know, Cohesity in Canada, or founded in Canada, but I think you've got global kind of HQs. Do you think we will have these sovereign models and regionalized winners? I do think it's healthy that there are models that are getting built in different places around the world, not just in in The US and and China right now. I think this is healthy in terms of diversity of of thoughts. I think it's healthy in terms of having a greater amount of people with access to technology. I do think for Cohere, you know, the vision isn't to be a Canadian company. Like, the vision is to be a global AI company, and I think, yes, you know, we have a head quarter in in Toronto. We have teams that are distributed around the world. We have a great team here in London, as well as in The US, and and France and other places. And so having that ability to deploy models that operate across the world, I think, is gonna be absolutely an important part of the the strategy for Cohere. I think there's a great opportunity. What it gives us to be headquartered in Canada is, like, a sensitivity to the fact that it's not always a one size fits all solution. You know, I go back to the research we've done. We've done leading work in terms of multilingual model. And it turns out it matters. You go to Japan, you go to Korea, and they do want models that work well in their language. People in the workforce are still operating in in the language of the country. So having a company that that is attuned to that, that values that that internationalization of model is actually important on the global market. On the team building side, obviously, Canada has great talent. You mentioned, obviously, some in London as well. What have been your biggest lessons, observations on team building in this, like, talent frenzy that we're in also? How how will you analyze that? One of the things that's that's important when you're you're building a a team for AI, I do think you need people who have vision, who have, like, a sense of, like, what can we create just because we're in a space where there's so much innovation that is still needed. So you need an ingredient of vision. That can be one, two, three people who bring that that ingredient of of vision. You need people who have amazing execution muscle. They don't care that it's their idea. They They care that if the team agrees on an idea, they are just gonna push this and get it done. They're gonna build a system. They're gonna run the experiments. They just have that technical rigor to execute. And then you need people who kind of, like, keeps a team together, who have, like, like, the sense of, like, who needs what to operate well and who are that social glue. Humans are still social beings, and that social glue in a team matters a lot. Where I've seen it fail is to have just sort of one type of person inside the team. So I'm I'm a big believer in building teams with with diverse complementary talents. So you can't just buy the Galactikos? I don't think you need to. I think you you really have to be thoughtful about putting people in a group. The other thing that helps a lot is for the team to have focus. You know, if it goes in all sorts of different direction, you'll lose that that that power that you get from from people working together. So having a lot of clarity. What's the North Star? What's the goal? Where are we going? Even if over time that needs to change, but that level of clarity is required for everyone to be working in the same direction. If you don't need to buy the Galacticos, why do you have, like, an Andrew Tullock, a Daniel Gross, an Alex Wang, and the Galacticos assembling? Is is that wrong? You do need a few of these, like, uber talents in the team. There's a relatively, you know, short number of people who just understand this technology very deeply. You do need some of this talent, and if you can afford it, you should you should get some of that talent. But you don't need all of your team. You need you need like a a team with complimentary skill as well. Does that create a good team? Like, if I gave you, you know, $10,000,000,000 to go build a team and you could buy a couple of these luxury star players, I feel like it's top trump cards for, like, sports teams. But you can buy a cup does that create a good team when one is a $3,000,000,000 person and then the rest did just average $50,000,000 people? Yeah. I wouldn't say no if someone offers me the the opportunity to to hire. There's definitely some really talented people in the field, and they deserve to be fairly compensated. This technology is going to have make a lot of people very rich and have major effects in terms of society. And so, you know, we should be rewarding the the talent. But I'd be very thoughtful about what are the teams that I put together and how do they work together rather than just, like, hire a roster of superstars without being thoughtful how they're gonna work together. So you it's it's so funny. So because of the impact that you can have in these teams, actually, the multibillion dollar price tags that you see can even be justified. Time will tell. I don't think it's necessarily needed to go at that scale, but time will tell. If I give you $10,000,000,000, what would you spend it on first? One of the things you need is a balance between talent and compute. If you have too much talent and not enough compute, you're wasting your time. Usually, like, an equilibrium between those those two pieces. I think we often underestimate the importance of data, and data is getting more and more expensive. And so I would certainly spend a good chunk of it on, on data as well. So many things to unpack there. Do you feel you have sufficient compute today? I think we are reasonably well resourced in terms of compute, in in in building the models data becoming more expansive? Data comes in in different forms. On the one hand, the days of, like, having data labelers who can say this is a cat and this is a dog are somewhat over, like, the easy task the AI can do. So we're getting in a space where we need more specialized tasks. So, you know, imagine you're building AI for enterprise. There's a particular business logic. You need to make make sure that you're catching the errors. You're gonna need someone with, like, deeper understanding of the tools, so that's more expensive talent to come in and actually prepare the data. There's also a lot of data that's synthetic data. When you're building agents, you need to build environments. And to build environments, you need some pretty creative folks who are going to build you, like, synthetic simulators. We've seen this on the robot side for many years, but people building robot simulators. Now you're building AI for enterprise, so you need to think of, like, how are you gonna simulate these work processes in a reasonably realistic way that the AI can train on that? And so that generation of environments and benchmarks and dynamic domains can be pretty expensive too. When you look at the expansive data and then you said, oh, you know, cat, dog, lamppost, I've got these caps you know, captchippers, you know, the click, the ones we have like a zer. I get them wrong. I legitimately get them wrong. I'm like, geez. They're getting harder. They're getting so hard. They are. They are. It's not just you. The other day, I called up my CFO. I'm like, I failed the revolute. I'm so sorry. I'll try again in half an hour. Please let my aid my agent answer until that one for me. It was embarrassing. But, the question that I have is, you know, when you look at Macaw, when you look at Surge, when you look at Turing, how do you evaluate that market which is providing a lot of that talent? Mhmm. Is that an ongoing enduring market, or is that just, hey, for the next three to five years? Mhmm. And training phase of these models? But I don't know what it looks like beyond that. I don't think it's a phase in the sense that I do think this partnership, we'll call it, between humans and machines, where human provide guidance to machine, we are in this for a long time. What will change is the nature of the information that the AI provides versus the information that the humans must provide as a compliment. Some of these firms may not be around in five years, but this notion of having humans guide the behavior guide and train the behavior of AI system. It it's super interesting. I I kind of, as an investor in in one of them, see all of them converge around, like, meetings do three things now. They used to just kinda be talent acquisition. Oh, we'll get you these people. And now they're like, we'll get you these people, and we'll get you high quality data that you can really use. And now it's like, oh, shit. We need this third pillar, which is we'll also help you implement that data into your models, do training, and help you with benchmarking and proving that it's actually, and now they need all three. Yeah. Are you seeing that third one where it's like implementation of their data as well? They don't just hand it over the fence. There's definitely some of that that's happening. I think for me, the the even bigger trend we're seeing is the moving from just labeling data to crafting environments to produce new new tasks. You said about synthetic data and that also being a very important segment to consider. Do you get model degradation when you get this kind of reinforcing loop of models learning on synthetic data which creates more data for synthetic and it actually degrades, or does it improve? It really depends how you're generating your synthetic data. So in some domains, if you think, like, images, languages, like LLMs talking to each other at some point, you definitely get the degradation, and that degradation is due to essentially, like, a loss of diversity of your data. So, you know, you can make an analogy. You know, you you take a bunch of people, put them on an island, and let them reproduce. You know, at some point, the genetic diversity is gonna keep shrinking. And so you get a reasonably similar phenomenon with, with models because you're not injecting diversity into the data. So for there are domains where lack of diversity means you get a collapse of distribution. There's other domains where you don't need diversity. If you think of, like, playing chess, playing Go, these kinds of games, we know exactly how to generate board configurations. And so we can generate tons of synthetic data, not endless because it's a closed world, but still tons of synthetic data and through that learn for a long time. Then there's domains that are sort of in between. If I think of coding, we can generate synthetic code. You take normal code, and we know how to inject diversity into the code. Like, I can take a couple of repositories, mix and match, apply an LLM to transform it. And so there's a way to generate synthetic data. The language is predictable enough, and there's enough structure that I also know how to inject diversity so that you don't get that collapse. So the hope is that especially in these domains, we can use a lot more synthetic data and do it without suffering from the degradation of performance. Do you worry that we are creating a world with just much worse code? A lot of people are concerned by the quality of code that's being outputted and actually how we're just relying on it pretty haphazardly. Do you worry about that? Let me make an analogy in terms of, like, the quality of generation. You know, you ask about code generation, but let me take you back to 2015 and image generation. I don't know if you have it in your mind, but the quality of the images that were generated we had image generation models in 2015. They were really bad. The resolution was bad. The composition was bad and so on. And from 2015 to about 2022 or so, we saw huge progress in terms of the quality of the image generation. So you think of code generation, like, right now, we're in the phase we were for image ten years ago. Yes. There's a lot of bad code that's getting generated. There's a lot of code that will get thrown away. But wait another ten years, and I think the quality of the code that's produced is gonna be excellent. What will the developer world look like in ten years when that is the case? If I carry my analogy further, I don't know if it's a reassuring scenario because if we look at where we are today in terms of image generation, there's just like the volume of image getting generated is huge. What matters now is sort of, you know, picking the picking the quality out of the volume. And so if I fast forward ten years on code generation when the we have the ability to generate a ton of code to do a ton of different things. We're going to need some selection mechanism to decide what code we actually want when there's actually value. And so that's gonna come. There's still gonna be some sort of editorial design choice someone needs to decide, like, of all the code we can generate, what's the code we want to generate? What do we need to be running in terms of our digital world? So it's like a chief curation artist. Yes. Within the company. Curation doesn't go away. Curation, verification. This is work that doesn't go away. Does the structure of teams fundamentally change then? You you it's funny kind of playing that back to you and then also playing back to you what you said earlier about the human and if that is the case, there's not much of a partnership, is that, between human and AI? It's a chief curation person sitting on top of a huge amount of artificially created code. Well, that's your 10 x productivity improvement there. It is. You're ticking that box, but it removes the human element there. You still you still need people with with intent. That's one thing that, you know, you need to decide what you want to build and what purpose does it serve. And so that that intent is still there, that that role of of critique is still there. So the team composition does change significantly once you suddenly have, you know, designers who in their hand have amazing tools to go directly from the ideas in their head to the to the digital world, maybe eventually to the physical world. That equation definitely changes. Do you think prompts and the way that we interact today with prompts, with chat, largely, is like the enduring interface for human engagement with AI? It's awfully limited, and prompts can mean a few different things, but but the idea of, like, typing in a box, that to me is very limited, and we're gonna break out of that box already. We're seeing a lot of, cases where voice is a lot more natural as an interface. I do expect we'll see, you know, gesture, eye gaze, these kinds of much more multimodal ways to interact with the with the AI rather than just stick in that in in in that prompt box. But language is incredibly powerful. So if you think of prompt as being more language as a way to express ideas and communicate with a machine, that's a powerful paradigm. I mean, as humans, we so much of our communication is based on language. I don't think we're gonna move away from that. It encodes information. You know, language words are symbols that encodes so much information so efficiently. And And so I don't think we're we're close to getting away from that. When you think about what you did believe that you now have changed your mind on, what's most prescient? Oh, I'm a scientist that is happy to be proven wrong anytime as long as there's new evidence. I'm genuinely curious to know. Other scientists are much more, like, holding on to very, very strong conviction. I have weak conviction, but very strong respect for the scientific method and and and rigor experimental rigor, you know, theoretical rigor as well. I used to be quite skeptical that neural networks were necessarily the ultimate solution to machine learning. I'd seen enough cycles of neural networks kind of peaking and and and then, being less less useful. And I used to think every time you change the scale of the data, you know, you go from hundreds of examples to thousand, thousands to hundreds of thousands to millions of examples. Every time you change the size paradigm that neural networks were the first thing we tried because they're our universal function approximator, and then something else comes out that was better. And that was true for the previous generations. You know, some of you may remember SVMs as, like, being better than the neural networks in in early two thousands. It seemed to be quite wrong on this one. Like, our neural net seemed to be here to stay. And the ability to do back propagation and gradient descent and all that seems to be a really powerful way to learn. What does everyone else believe quite strongly that you think they are quite wrong on? I don't have a lot of patience as a scientist for people who are predicting sort of the the extremist scenarios, whether it's the catastrophic risks of AI or whether it's the, you know, winner takes all, you know, AI becomes our overlord kind of scenario. I don't have a lot of patience for that. I wouldn't say it's necessarily widespread, but I just you lack scientific rigor to to analyze these kinds of scenario. I'm a much more pragmatic, grounded. I'm pro innovation. I'm excited to see where where AI is going and the problems it can solve, but I'm not so interested in just going around and, you know, making up science fiction scenarios. You've been on the most incredible you said there about kind of image generation 2015 and partly how much it's improved. We're seeing this kind of unbelievable capital supply go into the space in a way that we haven't seen, obviously, for many, many years. Is it a good bubble where we are getting incredible improvements and it's fundamentally advancing technology? Or is it a bad bubble where costs are becoming too exorbitant, teams too impossible to build, computers too difficult? Is it a good bubble or a bad bubble? I think about it as a bubble with bigger variance. It's like, you know, the upswing is gonna be bigger and, you know, there's going to be big downswings as well. And so there's a lot of variance into the system right now. As long as people have a tolerance to risk, then I think AI is a great investment, and we should continue to be supporting, you know, risk taking, new enterprise, new ideas. There's a ton of exciting new startups being created. We should continue to to support them. You just have to be tolerant to risk. I've had some people on the show suggest that, emails are, to put it delicately, bullshit, and that they don't actually mean anything anymore and, like, you know, humanity's last test, like, what does that really even mean? And we have these new tests that come over. What is this? And leaderboards, what is this? Is that fair, or do you think they actually serve a very effective utility to the ecosystem? I do think they they are, really good indicators. So I think you do need to take evaluation seriously in terms of knowledge, but you shouldn't take them seriously in terms of the ultimate goals. So, you know, evaluation, and there's lots of different benchmarks and so on. You have to decide, like, what type of models or model are you building, what's the characteristics of your system, and then think of evaluations as, like, unit test for the performance of your system. Software engineers will know what that is. Right? Like, you run through that evaluation, and that gives you, like, a signal of how the system is doing in a particular dimension. But as we're building systems that are more and more general, do very specific tasks, you don't optimize for these. We build AI systems that go into enterprise. None of our clients ask about, like, are you able to win the math Olympiad with this model? That's not what they care about. They care about bringing value to their business. Now we're curious to know how well we do on math problems because it can be predictive of behavior on other things, but you don't obsess over specific benchmarks. You kind of look at the ROI in terms of what you're trying to build. We mentioned there about kind of access for enterprises. Enterprises have money, and that's a great luxury in a lot of cases. Research institutes, universities often don't. With the kind of bubble like tendencies, people with money are able to afford to compute the talent. Are we seeing this kind of lack of access or democratization for a great institutions that are educational maybe who now can't afford to compete in this new world? Certainly, a lot of universities have a lot less resources than than companies today. That's not completely new. When I joined Meta in 2017, one of the reasons I did that is because I I could already see the the disparity in terms of access to compute, and I was really curious to see how you could do research with a lot more compute. But, you know, there's still amazing research that's being done in in universities. You go to the major international conferences, NEUROP, CICML, and others, and often the best paper awards are actually won by researchers out of universities. There's a lot of good ideas that you need to test out at small scale. And in a university, you have a lot more freedom to pick pretty risky ideas at a small scale. But still, you know, no one's asking you to to justify your your your research in in ways that that often happens in companies. So I think they have they play different roles in the ecosystem. And what's actually especially good is talent flows between between them. University students come in, do internships, take jobs at companies. We've also seen a movement of people coming out of these large companies, going back to university, teaching, sharing with the next generation what they've learned. How important is it to have seen success and how valuable that makes you? When you look at people like, Amira raising 2,000,000,000 out of 10,000,000,000, it's like, well, no one's seen the success that she's seen with OpenAI, so it's valid. Help me out as an investor. Is it that valid to place that much of a premium on access to seeing it at that level that we are, or is that slightly overpricing it? I think in many cases, you know, when it comes to deciding where to invest very early on when you don't have tangible tangible information. I mean, you look at people's track record, and there's a part of that that maybe, like, you know, what have they learned in terms of the the core recipe. But the other thing is also the achievement of having put together amazing teams who are building world class models, and there's a lot of subtlety to that. And so I think, you know, both of these ingredients are are important to consider. I don't If you were investing today and you were joining my team, which category would you most like to invest in? Be it security, be it generative AI, compliance, you you name it. Yeah. There's a lot of verticals, whether health care, scientific discovery, that I think have incredible promise where we're gonna see real tangible progress within five years that are going to change completely the face of what we can do. So that's probably where I'd where I'd push. That's very exciting on the health care front in particular. When you think about that timeline as well, I'd love to do a quick fire round with you, if that's okay. So I'd say a short statement. What would you most like to do, but because of technical or financial limitations, you're not able to? I'm super keen to figure out how we build societies of AI agents. We're doing it implicitly, but how do we look at populations of AI agents interacting together and having, like, a sandbox for for doing that? Maybe something I'll I'll get to do. Is it lack of time, resources, something else? There's just, like, a ton of different things to do, but keen to to see what happens there. When you think about that ecosystem of agents, you have children. Yes. And AI changes our relationship with other humans Yes. And friendship and social. How does AI impact social, friendship, connection? It definitely does. And, you know, there there's a sense that we spend a lot of our time in the digital world. And for some folks you know, I look two of my children, they spend a lot of time in the digital world playing online games with their friends. It's still very social. It's there must be some AI. There's the digital platform, but it's still a very social experience. Others have more individual experience. There's definitely a shift of this time we spent, towards that platform where we go look for that for that social element. Knowing what you know, what do you not let your children do? Eat too much sugar? Totally. That's so that's that, like, physical diet. Completely agree with that. Yeah. Is there a technical diet? I spend some time discussing, like, settings. I mean, like, you get an Instagram account. Great. You can have an Instagram account. But, like, what are the settings on that account? Making sure they understand. I mean, they'll go and change them what they want. Mom, isn't it? We're gonna discuss settings. I know. That was not a popular one. Did they listen? The thing with children is you don't know till later. Do you limit screen time? I spent a lot of energy, especially in their younger years, limiting screen times. My kids did not have a cell phone till they were 14, 15. Did you see adolescents? I have not. Okay. Watch it. Basically, a little boy goes up to his bedroom and, gets lost down kind of rabbit holes of TikTok and Reddit, and it does not turn out well. I have I've heard about it. I just haven't had time to to sit down and Do you worry about the the loneliness pandemic and then also just the mental health crisis that we have? I do worry a lot in general about making sure that that people are healthy mentally. We have to be careful about taking shortcuts and saying, you know, because suddenly, you know, we have certain platforms, we have AI and so on, that is causing that mental illness. You know, there are number of people who are suffering, and they deserve to to have good answers to the situation, and they deserve to we deserve to find real solutions to that. And there's a lot of people looking for shortcuts and short answers, but I think more research into that is definitely warranted. What's your biggest lesson from working with Zach? He is incredibly deep into understanding the work. Like, he does not coast, you know. When he started getting into AI, just the the depth of the question that he'd ask, he just gets really interested in the topic and goes super deep, and that then just informs everything he does after. So you can have the most amazing team, but, like, as a leader, you need to go deep and understand the work. Did you see him change? As anyone gets more knowledgeable about a topic, you get more decisive. There's a phase where you're really learning and trying to to understand, and there's a phase where you understand a lot of things and then you make your decisions faster. So certainly, that that shift happened. What one AI buzzword would you ban if you had a magic wand? Existential risk. Why? Because it just makes people afraid. And it's not out of fear that we make our best work and we take good decisions. Do you find the cost of talent exorbitant? Talent is costly. Talented people deserve to be to be paid well. And again, you know, someone coming in just because of money rarely is going to be the right person, but you do need to compensate people fairly. Final one. What are you most excited for? You we you don't like the existential risk. I don't like that. The doomsday planning. When you think about the positivity that can come, what are you most excited for when you look forward to the next three to five years? I do think some of the work in terms of AI for a scientific discovery is going to be pretty fascinating to see. It's just in terms of the doors it's gonna open up, the ability to explore combinatorial space of of solutions. So I'm curious about that. And then I'm super curious to see how can we actually make our models more efficient. There's larger and larger and larger models. No one wants to run these models. You know, I spend a lot of my career building, open source models, and I'll give you one example. You know, we were in in the frenzy of large language models, and I pulled the stats most downloaded models of last month. We had a model like Roberta from 2019, small language model, was getting 20,000,000 downloads a month. People want efficient models that they can use, that they can run. So I'm also super keen to see what we're going to be able to to do at the scale that runs on, like, one or two GPUs. Final final one. You said they're about kind of open. We seem to, like, be reverting to a closed world now. Is that the world with which we should predict and plan on? That's a deep mistake. I mean, I will continue to believe that especially for research, the ideas need to circulate and this thought that you can just, like, close us down is was absolutely false. I mean, people are circulated. Not think we are, though, moving into that world. Like, everyone seems to be closing systems, closing access. There are definitely a number of places, people that are closing down access. I don't think that is going to to be effective. Ideas will circulate, and and I also think it's a mistake from a point of view of fostering innovation. This has been such a joy. I've learned so much from this conversation. Thank you so much for putting up with my very basic questions, but I've loved having you on the show. My pleasure. Thank you. But before we leave you today, are you drowning in AI tools? ChatGPT for writing, Notion for docs, Gmail for email, Slack for comms, and you're constantly copy pasting between them all losing context and losing time.

Podcast Episode: The woman behind Canva shares how she built a $42B company from nothing | Melanie Perkins
Published: Sun, 02 Nov 2025 13:31:30 GMT
Description: <p><strong>Melanie Perkins</strong> is CEO and co-founder of Canva, currently valued at over $42 billion, generating over $3 billion in annual revenue, with more than 240 million monthly active users and, incredibly, eight consecutive years of profitability. But the journey was far from smooth. Melanie was rejected by over 100 investors during her first fundraising round, her team spent two years without being able to ship a new feature during a technical rewrite, and the company pivoted early from a yearbook publishing platform to become the design powerhouse it is today. Through it all, she maintained what she calls “column B” thinking: building toward a dream future rather than just using the bricks around you.</p><p><strong>We discuss:</strong></p><p>1. How “column B” thinking helped Melanie build Canva, by starting with an impossible vision rather than existing constraints</p><p>2. The power of setting “crazy big goals”</p><p>3. How Canva survived a painful two-year period without shipping any new features while rewriting their codebase</p><p>4. How Melanie pushed through 100 investor rejections, and how she used each rejection to strengthen her pitch</p><p>5. Canva’s “two-step plan”: build one of the world’s most valuable companies, then do the most good possible</p><p>6. Melanie’s vision for 2050 and why she believes imagination is the first step toward a better world</p><p>—</p><p><strong>Brought to you by:</strong></p><p><a href="https://vanta.com/lenny" target="_blank"><strong>Vanta</strong></a>—Automate compliance.

TRANSCRIPT
============================================================

There's a very famous story about Canva. Early on, you pitched over a 100 investors, and over a 100 investors said no to you. It was really clear in my mind that it was the future, and I thought the investors were wrong, frankly. But investors also gave really helpful feedback and feedback often in the form of rejection. They would say, oh, your market's not big enough. And I would say, it's gonna be huge. And I'd add a new page in my pitch deck that said how big the market I believe was. And then they'd say, you're the same as some other company. And I would say, hey. Now I've got a new slide in my pitch deck that shows all the players and the huge gap in the market that we believe we're going going to fill. One of your values, crazy big goals. I love that that has a value. The thing that I love about a crazy big goal is that you feel completely inadequate before it. You want to work really hard to will it into existence. I really like to start by just imagining what is the future that you actually want. Right now, I have a wall in my house, in my office, which is my vision for what I'd like the world to look like in 2050. I heard from one of your team members, Melissa Tan, that there's a deck like this. For every project you kick off, there's this big vision deck. And so we have this concept of chaos to clarity. Every idea starts in the chaos side, and then you have to work all the way to the other side, which is clarity. That very first step at the far end of chaos was quite a embarrassing step actually because you don't have mastery at that point. You don't have all the answers. A lot of people think of Canva as, like, a design graphics for, you know, social media and and marketing and things like that. But you also have spreadsheets, docs, whiteboards, charts, AI coding tool. It was funny looking back from really old decks. They were trying to do AI, but AI was actually a thing. Today, my guest is Melanie Perkins, CEO and cofounder of Canva. Melanie is on track to be the most successful female tech founder in history, and one of the most successful founders, period. Canva is currently valued at over $42,000,000,000, making over $3,300,000,000 in revenue a year. They've been profitable for eight years straight and are one of the hottest private tech companies in the world right now. But it wasn't always this way. Melanie was rejected by over 100 investors when she was trying to raise her first round. Their team spent two years rewriting their entire code base and were unable to ship any new features for over two years, something they expected to just take six months. And they even went through a big pivot early on from a yearbook publishing platform to the Canva that you know today. Melanie does not do a lot of podcasts. She shares stories that I've never heard before and lessons that I'm still thinking about. This is a really rare opportunity to learn from a legendary founder.

I'm excited to be here. I'm even more excited. It's such an honor to have you here. I am such a fan of yours. I'm such a fan of the company that you've built. Also, just everyone I meet from Canva is just, like, so nice and so awesome and so smart. And so, clearly, you've built something really special. I'm really excited to use this hour to learn as much as I can from you about how you did that. And we were actually chatting ahead of this about what would make the best use of this hour, and I asked you what you believe has been the biggest factor in the success of Canva. And you described something called building a column b company and column b thinking. I've never heard of this before. So let us start there. What is what is what is building column b company? What does that mean? Really great place to start. So I guess there's two ways of planning. The way that, you can plan is you can dream of, like, what is the perfect vision of the future? What what future do you want to exist in? What would you like the world to look like? What would you like companies to look like? And then going from there, which is completely improbable, a completely crazy big dream, and then working hard to turn that into reality. And the alternate is so, you know, just imagine you're you're building a castle on the hill and you're like, what would be the most magical, wonderful, mythical experience? And the other thing you can do is you can look at the bricks around you and you can say, what can I do with these bricks? How high can I stack them? What can I do? And I think most planning is often done by looking at the bricks and trying to stack them, and then you kind of, you know, you can create only so much. And so, I guess, the column b thinking is thinking about what is that magical, wonderful future that you then want to invest years and decades of your life actually building. And so, that's column a and column b in a nutshell. So column a is the traditional just like work from today's world, column b is work from this dream reality and work backwards from how to achieve that. Exactly that. This is exactly the way actually Brian Chesky thought. I worked at Airbnb for a long time, and it was always just like, think about the world, the dream, and then work backwards from that. So there's a lot clearly, also worked out. So, clearly, this is a an important lesson. In the example of Canva, just what is what what would have been column a for what Canva could have been? And what was the how did you think about the column b approach of what Canva in a dreamland could be? So column a would have been nothing, frankly, because, you know, the reality was when I was a university student with no company and no business or product or software experience, the reality would have been not not very much. And so it was all column b. It was all thinking about the wild future that we wanted to create. You know, imagine what would be publishing in the future? What would communications look like in the future? And it seemed really impossible that it would stay on on the desktop. It would stay really complicated. And it just seemed so apparent to me that in the future, it was going to be, like, completely different. Could I build that future? I had absolutely no idea. But the idea seemed completely likely, completely improbable that it wouldn't be the case that in the future design would be online and collaborative and really simple. And so starting from that, we then took that concept and applied it to the school yearbook market in Australia, with our first company, Fused Books. And then we applied it to Canva, where we want to take it much, much bigger. Let's talk about just how to actually go about building a call and b company. Say a founder's listening to this and they're just like, okay. I I wanna do this. What do they do? What are the steps? Where do you start? I really like to start by just imagining what is the future that you actually want. What is the world that you want to live in? What is the future of transportation? What is the future of healthcare? What is the future that you want to live in and exist in? And, you know, for example, right now I have a wall in my house, in my office, which is my vision for what I'd like the world to look like in 2050. And so it's not necessarily that you can bring that into existence or you can will that into existence, but just to start to get clearer on what you would like that world to be like. Would you like it to be more inclusive? Would you like it to you know, for me, one of the things I desperately want is everyone on this planet to have their basic human needs met. You know, what are those things that you believe are so important that you would love to see exist in that future? And, you know, I think an exercise we often do is like what is wild success for x? Or what is wild success for y? And then equally, what is terrible failure for those things? And you can apply that just to abstract thinking in different industries. You can do that, apply that for, we do that for the whole company, for different areas of the company. And I think just taking that very long timescale of ten years, and getting a really crisp idea of what you want or what you don't want, that's sort of the first step. And I think a lot of people don't spend quite enough time imagining that. And then the next part is you don't want to have this crazy big dream, and then do nothing about turning it into reality. You kind of wanna have a ladder that goes all the way up to the moon, which is your crazy wild vision, and then you want to have rungs that just like work its way up step by step. And so you want to get that really clear picture of the future that you would like and then just take little step after little step after little step. And it doesn't matter how small that first step is or how seemingly inconsequential, if it is working towards that future that you want to will into existence, then you'll keep on climbing up that ladder in the right direction. I think a lot of people hearing this might feel like, I do this. Yeah. I have a vision. I kinda I know where I'm going. I have this big idea. What do you think they might be missing about just what this actually means and why they're probably not thinking big enough, they're not making the time to think like this? I think it is easy to be discouraged by the two because they're completely two complete odds. Like, they're completely different ends of the spectrum. So one is dreaming about the future. Not that you think you can will into existence, just the future that you want. And then the next part is taking the tiny step that might be extremely microscopic. And it feels a little embarrassing to be like, I want a future that is, you know, whatever it might be and then to take such a microscopic step because I think you often have the future in one side or don't spend much time thinking about that, you're just thinking about the bricks before you. And so I think it's also naturally, we all get distracted by day to day. It's your your email, your Slack, the things that are kind of in your face, the reality that lives around you every day that kind of pulls you into this moment right now. And so I think actually just making time to spend thinking about that is probably one of the most critical pieces. Like, just literally dreaming, like, what is wild success in ten years? What is terrible failure in ten years? Is a really great place to start. It's just like spending some time there. And then, like, even if that is so big and so vast and so wild, having that very first step is so important because then you take that little tiny first step and then the next step. And then that compounds, you know, for us, it's been compounding over a decade as we continue to work towards that same mission and vision. I wanna hear how you operationalize this. I heard from one of your team members, Melissa Tan, that there's a deck like this. For every project you kick off, there's this big vision deck that talk about what that looks like. Because I think that's where people are like, okay. How do I actually do this? Talk about that deck. So we have this concept of chaos to clarity. And every idea starts in the chaos side, and then you have to work all the way to the other side, which is clarity. And so chaos can be an idea, it can be a problem, it can be a philosophy or a belief, and, I've got a joke that I find funny. I'm not sure if you will. But how do you how do you go from chaos to clarity? You add clarity. And so the idea is that, like, each, like, little step from chaos to clarity is, like, the very first step might be literally writing it down. So rather than it being in your head, you've written it down. Then the next step might be, starting to create a pitch deck on it. And the next step might be starting to refine that, turning it into some designs, turning it into a prototype. And then as you kind of go from chaos to clarity, it starts to become more and more real and more and more people can see it. And so just, like, taking those little incremental steps that adds clarity with every single step then starts to help will it into existence rather than it being something that's completely amorphous and just stays in your head. So I think that's why, you know, visual communication for us is so important is because otherwise, if it's just in your head, no one else can see it and you can't will it into existence. This makes me think about this concept of an ugly baby from the book Creativity Inc by, I think, Ed Catmull, where he talks about how new ideas are this ugly baby that nobody wants to look at and deal with. I don't like, I think he says they wanna kill. I don't know why you do that with an ugly baby. But there are these, like, very soft, subtle, fragile things, and it's really important to not kill them early and give them chance to survive. And that's kind of what I'm hearing here is, like, have this big vision that many people are be like, no way. This is completely absurd. And I love this idea. Okay. But here's, like, one step we could take there to see if this could be a thing. Yeah. I completely agree. And I think that's the thing is that the that very first step at the very, like, far end of chaos, it's very embarrassing because you're, like, I have this idea that is so big and so wild, and how the hell would I do that? I have no idea. And so it was quite a embarrassing step actually, because you don't have mastery at that point. You don't have all the answers. In fact, you have likely not none of the answers, but you just have the idea that you think would be cool. And ideally you get the idea that would be so cool that you want to work really hard to will that into existence. And so I think one of the really key parts is not only just having the idea, but thinking it's so cool that you're going to work for years to will it into existence. Actually, Melissa did a really amazing pitch deck recently about the vision of, I won't go into the details right here, but the vision of her space. And I was really excited about it. And so I think that that's the great thing about a pitch deck is that other people can see your thinking. And your thinking actually gets clarified as well as you go through that process. I talked to Melissa. I talked to a bunch of other people that work at Canva, that have worked at Canva. And something else I heard along these lines is this phrase, crazy big goals, which I think is one of your values. Crazy big goals. I love that as a value. Why is that so important? How does that fit into this? And just talk about the, the power of having crazy big goals. Yes. So right from the start of Canva, it was truly a crazy big goal. We're like, we want to empower the world to design and take all these things that are super complicated and put them into one platform and make it accessible to the whole world. And we want to rather than it be super expensive and unaffordable, we want to empower everyone everywhere in the world to design. So, I mean, that was the epitome of a crazy big goal. And, you know, if we macro out even further, we've got this two step plan, build one of the world's most valuable companies and do the most good we can do. So, again, a rather crazy big goal. And I think the thing that I love about a crazy big goal is that you feel completely inadequate before it. You know, another crazy big goal, we'd love to see everyone's basic human needs met on the planet. Like, completely crazy big, that truly shouldn't be. It's kind of absolutely absurd that that's the case, but we can go go into that later. But I think with a crazy big goal, then you want to work really hard to will it into existence. And so if you start with a reasonable goal or a realistic goal, then you kinda get to get to it and you're like, oh, cool. Whatever. Or more importantly, if something happens, you know, all the problems and roadblocks come along as they always do, then you're like, okay, I I I won't bother with that. And then you can just, like, go and choose another course. And so a crazy big goal is both crazy big, but it's also something that you think is incredibly important that you actually want to will into existence. Because it is so much work to will a crazy big goal into existence. So it better be one that you want to actually achieve. Is there a crazy big goal that you set that comes to mind maybe as a good example of this is what I'm talking about? Maybe a product you launched or featured back in the day? Yeah. I mean, so many things. So we have, our mission, empower the world to design, and we break it down into mission pillars. So empower everyone to design anything with every ingredient, in every language, on every device. Obviously, a mouthful. But then what we do is we take successive goals every year towards this mission. And so for designing anything, we start off with social media and presentations and now, like docs and websites and whiteboards and video. And so every year we're just launching more and more things to fulfil that part of the mission of empowering everyone to design anything. And then equally, in every language, we started in English and then it was Spanish and then it was 20 languages and then a 100 languages and then hard languages like Arabic and Hebrew and Urdu and, you know, right to left languages. And now, you know, we're in a 100 plus languages now, and now we're really doubling down on the localisation experience to make it feel truly local in every market around the world. And so you can see how having these very big audacious goals that you then just like take a step after step, towards helps then wheel it into existence. Or on every device, we started off obviously just with a web platform and then we launched our iPad app and then iPhone and then Android. And then we spent years investing in cross platform, so we have the same feature set across every device. And so you can see how these, like, big amorphous things that seem very outlandish, you can then just will into existence after continual investment for a decade and it compounds over time. I see how all this is starting to phase together. There's this big, crazy, ambitious vision, and below there are the mission pillars that are feeding into this vision and then the crazy big goals within each of those mission pillars to measure your progress towards all these, components of the mission. Exactly. Exactly. Okay. So with all that in mind, there's also this kind of trade off you have to make of just how ambitious you get because oftentimes sometimes, maybe you never missed the goal, but most many times people miss these very ambitious goals. How do you just find that balance between ambitious, crazy, but doable enough where people don't get discouraged? I think with a crazy big goal, the thing we have been really great at is achieving them. The time frame that we achieved them on has not always been, very reliable. We have certainly not been able to have, ping dot. What's the what's the Bullseye? We have not been very accurate with timing. But it's really interesting. I look back at a twenty twenty one twenty twenty one vision deck that we made, obviously, in 2021, but it was about 2026. And it was fascinating to see how much we'd actually been able to achieve from that vision deck, and how many things were currently still in flight. And so by having that I thought in 2021, some of those things may have happened a little quicker, but over the over the, you know, last five years, they've really been coming into reality. And so, you know, we might think things are gonna take six months and they take a year. We might think things are gonna take six months and they take two years, as has been the case. We might think something's actually gonna take our entire lifetime as some of those really truly crazy big goals. And in fact, I don't even know if we can ever achieve them, frankly. But they're such an important goal that even if you make a little step in their direction, they're worthwhile nonetheless. Whether you like him or not, Elon, this is similar to his. If you watch him, he has sets these really ambitious goals and then often is far late on achieving them. But clearly, it has worked out in achieving the crazy things that he's achieved. Something else I hear is you celebrate these goals in a really unique way to, talk about that. So when we have these crazy big goals, we also have couple them with really fun celebrations. And so we attempt to make the crazy big goals happen in a moment in time. So then when we achieve them, we actually have a really fun moment. Because if you're just trying to plod towards the top of the mountain always and you never, like, take a little moment to pat yourself on the back, it would feel a little arduous. And so, you know, over the years we had all sorts of fun little celebrations where we have smashed Greek plates and released doves and had a little La Tomatina festival and Oh, wow. You know, all sorts of fun things just to take a moment with the team to celebrate that huge achievement. And so I think that that's, you know, you wanna celebrate what you want to, really focus on and what you want everyone to take that moment. So when you achieve that crazy big goal, when we launch in Spanish, when we hit a 100 languages, you know, and then so forth across the company, taking that moment to actually pat yourself on the back and pat the teams on the back and say, hey, we did this thing. That thing that seemed really hard, we've now achieved. And, you know, the mission is often you know, each of the different mission pillars, they're obviously a long area of investment that's gonna take a long time to get to. But being able to celebrate each of the the rungs on that, on the way there, I think is extraordinarily important. And then it makes everyone, you know, everyone works extraordinarily hard to bring them to life, and then it gives everyone a little moment to to feel proud of themselves. It'd be very motivating to get to just break a bunch of plates. I really like that. So You need to bring that one back. We haven't done that in a while. It's a good one. I just love how concrete you're making this. So it's, you know, set these crazy big goals, find the components of the goals, set numbers there, and then figure out the kind of the steps you take to achieve these things. All feels very easy. Kind of, on the flip side of that, this is a segue. People hear these stories. They hear your story. They see Canva over the years, and it's just this, like, up into the right, huge success story of one of the most successful companies in history. I imagine there have been many periods where things weren't going so great and when maybe things didn't look like they worked would work out. So let me just ask you this. Over the over the course of building Canva, once it started to click and started to feel like it was gonna be a thing, was there a point where it, like, started to again feel like, well, maybe this may not work out. Maybe there's a huge setback that we may not get over. I think it's just a constant evolution. Like, every time the company doubles in size, pretty much all your systems break. All the things that were working don't work. You know, a little example, in the early days, we'd stand up and everyone would present their, present their goals, what they're working on every day, every week, and then it kinda moved every month. And then it was just like it was just taking too long because we've got so many people. And then it was sort of like we'd started doing these things called season openers. And season openers were really fun where we got the entire company together. We talked about the goals that we'd achieved. And it was so funny because ahead of season openers, everyone would launch everything because they wanted to do it ahead of the season opener. And then we'd also set the goals for the coming cycle, for for the coming season at that point in time. But then they started to become, like, six hours long because we had so many people and so many teams. And so, like, trying to find that right, to with the same philosophies of deep context for everyone, with the same philosophies of the celebrations and the goals, I'm, like, trying to find that right flavor at every stage of scale is definitely hard. And so I think it's just like a constant work in progress. Or, you know, back to your earlier point about timing of things, we were doing a front end rewrite and we thought it would take about six months. It was really important because it was critical for cross platform. It was critical for right to left. It was critical because we could only have five people working in our editor at any point in time because of the way the code base was structured. And we thought it was gonna take six months, and then it took two years. And, it was two years of not shipping any product, two years of a product company not being able to ship product. And, like, that is such a core motivation for our team. He's, like, shipping something, seeing great customer feedback, And then that kind of makes everyone feel happy and like we've got momentum. And it just felt like we're in a dark, dark tunnel, that we could hardly see the end of the tunnel. And we didn't really know how long it was gonna take because it just had to take as long as the tunnel was gonna take. And it was, you know, a very hard time because, you know, other people would be launching this and that, and it was we weren't. You know, eventually, we got out of that tunnel, and it was extremely important that we did that work. We've now got, you know, two and a half thousand engineers, and we're able to deliver amazing things that would have just, like, been completely infeasible. But oh, and and simultaneous collaboration was all like, so many things were baked into this. But, yeah, it was not a fun period of time. A product company not shipping product is is not really a recipe for fun. For two years. For two years. I feel like every builder listening to this knows exactly what you've been through and maybe not in that scale and those stakes, but you start on something. Oh, yeah. It will be take a few weeks and then a year later, you're still working on it. Totally. Had it just was the mood really, I don't know, sad internally? Just that must have been, like, two years. That's a a long time not to ship anything. Just what was it like internally during that period? I think it was kinda everything internally. Like, we we we made it into a bit of a game. We had this game board, and we I bought these little, like, rubber ducky sort of bath toys. And we had this, so we had all the little the components represented as a bath toy on this, board. And there was, like, all these stages of, like, home, kind of went launched in product. There was an emergency lane. At the end of it was home and hosed. And we, like, did these weekly stand ups where everyone would come in and talk where their bath toy was at. And kind of just like, we tried to make it fun and for the team. So it was partly fun and it was partly distressing, as all of our investors were like, hey, you know, that thing. So I think it was it was it was both things at the same time. It was bonding, let's say. Yeah. Okay. Speaking of investors, speaking of other hard times, there's a very famous story about Canva. Early on, you pitched, over a 100 investors. And over a 100 investors said no to you when you're just starting Canva. That's I think that's more of the investors than any founder I've talked to, like, actually tries to pitch. It's it's impressive you tried that hard and went for so many pitches and finally got someone to take a bet. Now you are something like a $40,000,000,000 company making 3,300,000,000.0 ARR. I think there's something like 240,000,000 monthly active users. One of the hottest private companies in the world. Just how does how does this feel? I don't know. It was really clear in my mind that it was the future, and I thought the investors were wrong, frankly. But investors also gave really helpful feedback, and feedback often in the form of rejection. So they would say, oh, your market's not big enough. And I would say, it's gonna be huge. And I would add a new page in my pitch deck that said how big the market, I believe, was. And then they'd say, you're the same as some other company. And I'd say well, and that coupled with rejection, and I would say, hey, now I've got a new slide in my pitch deck that shows all the all the players and the huge gap in the market that we believe we're gonna going to fill. Or most investors just knew absolutely nothing about design or the industry that we're in. And so we then ended up with the first few slides saying, here's the the lay of the land today. Here's the problem that we're going to solve. And so while it was extraordinarily frustrating, their feedback made us stronger and made our pitch deck stronger. And it was sort of like, you know, from that chaos to clarity. At the start, it was just like this idea, and then through the copious amounts of rejection, the pitch deck got stronger and more refined. So then when people you know, the first time I remember I spoke to someone for hours and they eventually got it. They were really committed to understanding what we were trying to do. But then, you know, not everyone has six hours to understand a concept. And so being able to take all the gems of wisdom from that conversation and have that understood really clearly in a really short period of time and have all of the reasons that people were rejecting us pre answered in that that initial pitch deck was really important. And I think that's probably one of the reasons why, you know, when I look back at our twenty twelve pitch deck, it's so valid and really still captures what we're doing today. And so I think that rejection in some ways makes you stronger if you can persist through. Well, I think beyond that, I've never heard this part of the story. It's not just persisting, it's actually iterating and and, taking feedback that you're hearing to continue to evolve the pitch to a place where, okay, I finally get what you're doing. That is such a cool part of the story. Is there how much of the product like, how much of that vision and product changed throughout that journey versus just the way you pitched it and and convinced people? It was pretty consistent, but the way we articulated it changed greatly. And so, for example, I wouldn't, in the early days, articulate the problem very much. I spent into, like, here's the cool solution. And so then the first few pages became very much more problem based. So because if people don't understand the problem, then they can't understand or care about your solution. And so there was a lot of a lot of refinement on the way it was articulated. And but the actual vision itself, I think, was pretty consistent through. I'm, guessing a lot of founders ask for your advice on raising money, getting started, having gone through so much rejection early on. What do you what's your general advice to folks that are having a hard time fundraising? I mean, I can only go on my experience, but I think it's sort of like the dark tunnel analogy. Just oh, chaos to clarity. Let's go read that one. It's a slightly friendlier analogy. And I think just taking the rejection and turning into things that you can control. So I can control my pitch deck. I can control the number of people I'm speaking to and I just spoke to literally everyone. And I think that, like, continuing to use it to refine it rather than taking it as a personal rejection, I think it's really important to think, like, how can I improve? How can I help someone to understand it? Some people are never going to understand it. I remember pitching an investor that had the lean startup book on their behind them when they were when I was pitching them. And, they were never gonna like Canva because we were not the lean startup. That was not the way that we're approaching it whatsoever. So there's some people that are just gonna never like you, and that's okay. I think it's important to find some people that do like what you're trying to say and trying to do. And, you know, kind of finding your tribe, I think. I think as an investor, this is really interesting to hear because it tells you there are companies like Canva out there that everyone's turning down. 100 a 100 investors passed on that you might still be able to invest in. Talking about your growth as a leader, say, if you compare Melanie of today to Melanie of, I don't know, twelve, thirteen years ago when you were just starting Canva, What would you say is most different in terms of, leadership? I don't really know. Probably if you ask other people around me, they'd probably be more observant. But it it is funny because there's some things that I think that I need to change. And then I realize, like, you know, go into it the same as some other company. And sometimes we even try that for a while, and then we we try that out and we're like, that's you know, it didn't really work for us. And it's kind of like building a house that you want every brick in the house to match. And if you go and try and take some bricks from someone else's house and stick it in your house, it's probably gonna not look very matched. And so trying to find things that are authentic to us and are authentic to the, you know, everything that's come before it is just that constant constant thing and then each stage of scale of the company, rather than going taking someone else's bricks and trying to stick that in your house, trying to build the thing that's authentic. So I think there's many things that are the same but obviously the stage and scale and we're constantly having to give away hats. And so I you kinda think about it in the very early days, it was just a few of us, or just two of us in infusion and then three of us in just a little tiny group, and you kinda wear a 100 hats. And And then you have to be able to give away those hats to other people that can then do that way better than yourself. And so I'm sure there's been a few skills, I guess, I would've had to have developed over the last decade, to be able to give away those hats. But, yeah, I think there's a lot of things that we've had to do and double down on that was more authentic to the way we, way we did it in the early days, actually. I I love that story. I think, again, if anyone working at a company that has gone through a lot of growth, has experienced that when people from other companies come in, and here's how we did it at this company. Is there is there an example of some there that just, like, here's something that this company brought in and people from this company thought we should do, and we tried and didn't work? I won't go into specific examples, but so many times over. And I think that I mean, maybe that's probably in answer to your other question. Like, not we did things our way because that was the only way we knew. And there was many, many times over the years that we're, like, didn't have confidence in the way we were doing things. And we were like, oh, they they've done it from a big company that's bigger than our company. Let's go do that. And that hasn't always worked out so well for us. And so, yeah, I think confidence in how we take what is authentic to us and do it at the next level of scale is a constant work in progress. It feels like, you know, as I was saying before, systems break and need to be reinvented, but also reimagined to that next layer of scale rather than going to try to get something off the shelf from another company. I imagine it also helped that you were in Australia away from the Bay Area and and where all these other, you know, big companies are at, just being being able to do it your own way? Yeah. Very much so. Did you know that I have a whole team that helps me with my podcast and with my newsletter? I want everyone on that team to be super happy and thrive in their roles. Justworks knows that your employees are more than just your employees. They're your people. My team is spread out across Colorado, Australia, Nepal, West Africa, and San Francisco. My life would be so incredibly complicated to hire people internationally, to pay people on time and in their local currencies, and to answer their HR questions twenty four seven. But with Justworks, it's super easy. Whether you're setting up your own automated payroll, offering premium benefits, or hiring internationally, Justworks offers simple software and twenty four seven human support from small business experts for you and your people. They do your human resources right so that you can do right by your people. Just works for your people. Is there anything else that is a good example of how you did something pretty different from how other companies operate? Anything else that comes to mind as a as a fun example? The goal driven structure I think, you know, the things that we're talking about before, so the mission, actually breaking that down into the mission pillars, breaking those mission pillars down into the goals that we're then pursuing and then celebrating those goals when we do achieve them, I think is a deeply under loved, way of building a company. Often people have a mission that's kind of on the wall somewhere, and then what they're actually doing and the way they actually make money and the way that, you know, the way people actually spend their time is in a very, very different direction from that original that original mission. And I think the magic is when you can bring those two things together. And so you can have your mission, you can have your mission pillars that are actually helping to achieve that. And I think there's a real authenticity in that for customers as well, is that you're actually doing the thing that you promised you do and it all ladders up together. It's certainly not an easy way to run a company, but I think that when you do get that formula right, I think that there's a a lot of authenticity with what you're saying you're doing you're actually doing. I wanna come back to that. That's a whole, really cool process. Do you have with closing the loop with customers? But something else I wanna talk about while we're in this topic of growth over time, I saw you post something about how you had to realize they had to slow down and not just work, work, work like crazy. Talk about just that realization and why that ended up being so valuable. So in the early days, I would just work seven days a week round the clock. You know, in our very first company, we actually had printing presses because we were printing the yearbooks in my mom's house and then delivering them to schools around Australia. And, you know, in the early days of Canva, we certainly, you know, were working all weekend, all hours of the day. It was just constant. But when you've been doing this for a while, if you just keep working at that pace, you know, I don't think it's good for anyone's health, mental health, or any anything else. So I think finding ways to continue, like, you know, I still work extraordinarily hard, but to continue to have that balance in my day to day where I actually go to sleep, I, you know, I find time to do things like going for walks or doing yoga, journaling, I find extraordinarily helpful, to make sure that I can always bring my best to everything that I'm doing. It's, it's easy to say that kind of stuff. It must be really hard to actually make time for that thing. Is there anything for those sorts of things, is there anything that you do that allows you to actually protect that time to actually do these things? Because as you said, there's a billion things that are just looking for your attention constantly. I feel like I've developed some healthy habits over the years. I don't have email slack on my phone. And so when I shut my laptop, I actually tune out. And then if there's a real issue, I'll get an emergency call or page. But I think trying to delineate, I think is really important. So when I'm working, I'm all in. And then when I'm not working, I'm all out. And actually giving that mental space, I think, is really important. I've spoken to a lot of founders that haven't quite found that and then do struggle with it. You know, so when they're not when they're working every weekend, it feels like the right thing, but then you're kind of missing sometimes you can miss the forest from the trees when you're just working harder and harder, but maybe you're actually working on the wrong thing. And so I think being able to step away a little just to be able to get perspective to be is actually really beneficial. I wanna come back to this closing the loop, process, let's say, is that you have, where you, figure out what to build. A lot a lot of your ideas come actually from the community. Talk about just that process and how many of your ideas actually came from your community. Oh, it's one of my favorite things. We've been doing it for years now. And so we get more than a million requests from our community every year, and we then we've got a whole incredible team that then tallies them, breaks them down, and then delivers them to all of our product teams, and then those actually get closed. So this year, we've closed more than 200 loops, but we know that each one of those things is going to be loved and needed by so many more people that don't bother to actually fill out the request form. And so so many things from gradient text, like, little things like gradient text, to really big things like our sheets product. There's just been countless products. In the early days with our AI products, we didn't release them to teachers because we knew there was a lot of hesitancy for, teachers using AI in the classroom. And we got so many requests from teachers saying, can I please use this magic right in the classroom? And so then we, unlocked that and put on safety controls for teachers. And so it's just constant actually. It's just part of that product process. I think there's two parts to product. One is building the future, and towards the mission and the mission pillars, as I was saying before. And the other is actually listening to our community and building what they want. And so I think that that's the two core pieces of product in my mind. And, you know, there's so the closing the loop comes in so many different forms. There's the explicit asks and then the other thing that we double down on all the time is user testing and watching people use it. And if people hesitate clicking a button or people don't quite understand how something works, it's amazing to me how you can find 10 random people on the internet and they can give such astute feedback that then is so representative for such a large number of people. So I personally run hundreds, if not thousands of user tests, myself, and it's been deeply embedded in our product teams also. Wow. That must be really stressful for someone, looking at a test of Canva trying to try someone when you're in the room. It's actually we do it all online, actually. We I I mean, the ones I've run are are typically online. So people are so much more frank, I think, when they just it's just them and their camera, and they don't really, yeah. They they tell you really how it is. Is there a tool or a kind of a process there that you find really helpful? I don't know if you wanna name names of products or anything like that, but it's something that you find helpful or useful. Yeah. We we use a lot of usertesting.com. I find that super super valuable. Alright. Go user testing. Okay. Something else that I know is really important to you and also really unique to Canva is something that's called the two step plan. You mentioned this earlier. I wanna definitely talk about this. What is the two step plan? Why is this so important to you? Yeah. So when you were asking about crazy big goals, I think this is our most macro, most crazy biggest goal. Step one, build one of the world's most valuable companies, and step two, do the most good we can do. And in our early days, I thought I'd do step one and then step two and realized that actually step one can fuel step two and step two can fuel step one. And so that's been a really big part of Canva for some years now. In the early days, we took the 1% pledge, which I think is an incredible program. Every single person, every single company should should take that, where you get 1% of time, money, equity and, profitability. And I think that's a really easy thing to do in the early days that then can compound greatly over time. We also knew that Canva's equity was obviously going to be a really key part of it. So, Cliff and I owned, a little over 30% of Canva and so we decided we were going to take 30% of Canva and use it to do the most good we can do. And we are doing that. So we're doing all of our donating through the Canva Foundation. We've just, over the last few years, we've donated $50,000,000 to Give Directly where they give money directly to people in Malawi who are in extreme poverty and then they can use that money, on their family to go to school, to get healthcare, to start small businesses, to get a roof so they can sleep in without being wet. You know, just like real truly basic human needs things. And we've just announced that we're going to be, giving another $100,000,000 over the next four years, to people in extreme poverty. And it's just like when you go and sit with people and you hear about how they're spending, you know, what's very microscopic amount at $550 is, you know, doesn't buy us that much, but it's a life changing amount of money for for people in extreme poverty. And it's truly transformational what it can do. And, you know, you meet people and you hear their stories and it's truly the best money I could ever imagine spending. And, you know, that crazy big dream I was mentioning earlier of everyone having basic human needs met, it's so completely insane that that isn't the case today. There's no specific reason why people don't have their basic human needs met on our planet. We just haven't got our act together as humanity. And so that is a truly crazy big dream. But back to the two step plan. Step one, build one of one of the world's most valuable companies. And step two, do the most good we can do. And, you know, finding ways to do that at the same time, I think, is extraordinarily important. That's incredible. It makes me think about, not to mention Elon again, but Elon's three step strategy plan. And it's like build better cars versus this is like, okay. Solve all the problems of the world and and make the world a better place. What a better master plan. I can compare. And something else about this that I love is a lot of companies have this have something philanthropic going on with the company, and it's like sitting in a doc on some page as part of their mission. It's not actually that big of a deal to them. What I hear from folks at Canvas is something you talk about all the time. This is, like, a actually core part of how you work and think and how you set goals and set vision emissions. Yeah. I'm happy to hear that. I wouldn't do Canva if it wasn't going to have a positive impact on the world. Like, for me, getting really rich is not a goal unto itself whatsoever. It's a means to an end. And, you know, I've been very blessed to be able to, you know, do some work and that creates wealth that can then go and have people's basic human needs met. You know, it's completely, yeah, but they they're working just as hard that they don't have the opportunity and, you know, even, yeah, our education product is now used by a 100,000,000 people each month and we are in, you know, most school districts and rolled out across countries and being able to bring quality education tools to every, and we give that away for free as well. Giving, being able to help empower schools all around the world and we're gonna be doubling down and doubling down into that product to bring quality education to all. I think it's it gives so much more meaning behind work. You know, we've also between our education product and our nonprofit program where we also give away our paid product for free, we we're we're giving away $1,500,000,000 of product a year now. And so the impact that that can have and the ripple effect of that, I think, is pretty great. And I think for all of us, it gives a lot more meaning to our work than, you know, get rich. Okay. So speaking of product, coming back to that, you guys are launching something maybe you've already launched it by the time this comes out. What I heard described as the the the biggest launch in Canva's history. No big deal. That's a high bar, considering all things you guys have launched. What are you launching? Why is it such a big deal? So we are extraordinarily excited about what we are launching. We I guess the whole mission of Canva is to empower the world to design. And so what has been enabled by new technology with all of AI has been just really profound enabled enabling people to take their idea and turn it into design a design and have as little friction between those two points. So we are doubling down radically on our video product and bring some incredible capabilities to our mobile and desktop platform. We are, launching email, which has been one of our most hotly requested features, from enterprise customers around the world and business customers around the world who want to be able to design with Canvas drag and drop ease and to be able to create an email. We're launching forms. We are launching probably one of the most exciting things is the way we're embedding AI across the entire product suite. And so you can actually, use AI to design a presentation, a video, a, email, a website. All of these things can actually now be done inside the core editor inside the design tab, which is used by a 170,000,000 it's used a 170,000,000 times a month. And then on our elements tab, which is used 900,000,000 times a month, we are also embedding AI. So you can actually generate a video, you can generate a, Canva code, and you can generate photos all directly inside that platform. And then we're also launching comments as lots of our customers use Canva, to comment and collaborate. And now you can actually just tag at Canva, and you can collaborate. You can just say, hey, like, can you make this title shorter? Can you do this? Can you do that? And it has all of the context of the design. So in situ, you can actually just have a collaborator that can help get your work done. So we are pretty excited about all of this. Amazing. I something I'm gonna just let people know. I don't know if people know all this. How many products you all have now? I think a lot of people think of Canva as, like, a design graphics for, you know, social media and and marketing and things like that. But you also have spreadsheets, docs, whiteboards, charts, code AI coding tool. And now, what I'm hearing is email, forms. There's probably a few other things I'm not thinking about. Design anything. We're we're literally living up to that. Oh, my god. Million people, design a presentation in Canva each month now. And it's it's pretty fascinating to see that when you speak to I saw a a tweet some time ago that's they were talking about how it's a generational thing that a certain generation uses Microsoft, a third generation uses Google, and then it was Gen Z, like, presentations have become the way they design a presentation is in Canva. But it's not just generational for for those of other other generational ilk. Yeah. But it's it's it's been fascinating to to see that come to life. The email product, is that like a email client product or it's a design emails that you can then send through your products? It is design emails. So you can design email, then you can take that code and you can pop it into any plat email platform that you use. How How do you think about products you're gonna expand to? I know there's, like, trade secrets here. You don't wanna tell everyone where you're going next, but just how do you approach, here's where we're going next? So our mission, empower the world design. Empower everyone to design anything with every ingredient in every language on every device, and just take those things very literally. So to literally design anything, to literally, publish anywhere. And so, you know, we now print in, 50 something countries around the world and you can get it printed delivered to your your house. And we plan to I actually did that while you're on here. Awesome. I have I have one. That's right. I wasn't planning this, but I had a bunch of this print thing delivered to my house. Oh, cool. People go, like Exactly. We have to go to a print shop in this freaking graphic, and then, well, here's a button. Let's click that. You just click print, and it pops up beautifully packaged to your door. I don't know how that works. Yeah. I don't know how you did that, but it worked. How cool. That is very cool. And so, yeah, I guess literally bring these things to life. Oh, we're, like, launching three d as well. So, like, e all of these things, we will be bringing to life literally and just picking up, like, what is the most strategically important next thing, to enable everyone to design anything, to enable everyone to publish anywhere. And we have been doing that for a decade, and we'll continue to do that forevermore using the latest technology to truly bring people's ideas to life. Okay. So this is helpful. So if someone's like, oh, well, will Canva come for my my space? It's are the people designing thing? That was design and also what was it? Publish? Publishing anywhere. Okay. Publishing and designing. Okay. So if you're doing any designing or publishing, watch out. From a macro perspective, there was, creativity tools and productivity tools. And what Canva really does is we're literally smack bang in the middle of that Venn diagram of creativity and productivity rather than making our customers have to make a choice between those two tools two suites. Something I wasn't planning on asking about, but I think it's on everyone's minds. There's always this, like, Figma and Adobe, and then there's Canva. And there's kind of a bunch of places we could go with this. One is just at the beginning of the journey where a lot of founders try to figure out their wedge and their specific niche. Just how did you think about that? Like, here's how we might have a chance to I know Figma wasn't even around back then, I don't think. Just, like, how did you approach your early wedge of users? One of the most important things that we did was we didn't really worry about competitors at all. We actually just saw where is there a gap in the market that we can uniquely fill and what what can we solve a problem a core problem that people currently have today. And so with our first company, that was yearbooks in Australia and there wasn't great tools, and these yearbook coordinators got thrown in to have to design something and you then have no design experience. And, you know, we spoke to every single customer, we gave them an over the phone tutorial, we understood all of their pain points. We got continuous customer feedback and then we tried to reiterate and improve. And then when we were thinking about Canva, a few years into that actually, one of the schools said, I love this product so much. Can I use it to design newsletters? And, you know, they had all sorts of other things that they wanted to use it for. And we kinda looked around and we're like, oh, like, there's still nothing on the market. This was like a few years into it that actually does the thing that we're doing but for all these other things. And so it was it was much more like where is the gap in the market that people are currently having a pain point? And if you can solve that pain point really well and solve it in such a way that people actually wanna pay for it because they it is truly solving a real pain point that they have, I think that kinda sets it up for success rather than, be a problem or a solution looking for a problem. So what I'm hearing there is you didn't overthink. Here's my ICP. Here's, like, the wedge and the strategy of how we expand into this large thing. It's like, here's people with a problem that hasn't been solved in years that we keep seeing. Let's try to solve it. Exactly that. And if you if you take that problem centered approach that helps people to achieve something they actually want to do in real life, you're probably gonna be in a reasonably good spot, especially if it maps to a larger market. That's a particularly great thing. You know, if it only solves one person's problem, that might not be a great company going forward. But if a few people have that same problem. But I think that again, like, back to that big ladder and that first rung, not getting too I think it's better to solve a small number of people's problems really well than trying to solve a large number of people's problem not very well at all. Something I can't not ask about is just how you think about AI in your product. You mentioned how you integrated or all through the product. Just, you know, you guys are doing really good stuff with AI. A lot of companies are struggling to find something really that works great. Do you have do you have just, like, a philosophy of here's how we integrate AI into Canva where it ends up being really helpful and and people love it? Your question is actually the answer at the same time. I think being able to integrate it into the product where it actually helps people to get their work done, where it genuinely helps them to achieve their goals, and then being really open to listening to your community and hearing what they're loving, what they're struggling with, and refining from there, I think is really, really important. Just because AI is all the rage and investors really like AI, doesn't necessarily mean it should be front and center, in but if it can genuinely help your customers to achieve their goals, so, you know, what the thing that I was mentioning before, enabling people to communicate their ideas and have little friction between those two points, AI is just kind of like, yeah, naturally a very critical part of that equation for us. In fact, it was funny looking back from really old decks. We were trying to do AI before AI was actually a thing because it really was critical to what we were trying to do. Even in our 2012 deck, you can kind of imagine how AI very much fit into the equation because of exactly what we're trying to do. I'm gonna keep us on the AI thread and take us to AI Corner, which is a recurring segment on this podcast. So here's the question, what's a way you found in your personal life and work life to use AI where it ends up being really helpful, something really interesting that people might find useful? So many things. So AI is often the first if I'm, like, having an idea, it'll be the first place that I go and explore the idea. And now with Canva and you can just tag Canva. I can say, give me more ideas of this. And it's, like, shockingly great because it has all of the context from the design. It's actually integrated deeply into your workflow. Another really fun thing I do, is an AI walk. And it's when I just put my, earpods in and then I go for a walk and I just say everything on my mind. And I use that to then kind of filter out my thoughts and figure out what are the things I need to action. And it kind of helps, again, get out of the weeds and think about things from a more macro perspective rather than from the things that might be in my Slack messages or in my email. It just gives you that sort of helpful vantage point, I find. So, yeah, so many things. For the voice note tool, is there a tool that you find useful for that? Yeah. I I might use, Apple Notes or directly into Canva Docs, and then I actually just do the brain dump into Canva Docs and then just, do like, summarize them. So yeah. It's Got it. And so you just use, like, native, microphone Exactly. Dictation sort of thing. Nothing fancy. Yeah. Yeah. I like it. This reminded me of you mentioned earlier in our conversation you have this you have this vision board that you said is, like, for 2050. Is that right? Yeah. That's right. Can you share something from that vision board? I'll tell you why the vision board came about because it's only been in recent months. I did feel like as humanity, we are on a bit of a freight train. And that freight training is I think if we take a lot of visions for a lot of different companies and a lot of things that are happening and you just fast forward fifty years or maybe to twenty fifty and you say, are we in a safer world? Is the world the place that we want our kids to grow up in? Is this the humanity that we want? I didn't feel that the train that we are headed on always feels great. In fact, it it scared me quite greatly, for a whole host of reasons. And so I sat with that feeling for a little and then I kinda got to work on my 2,050 walls and, you know, back to the chaos to clarity. The first thing was writing my 2,050 wall and I've kind of really been loving, I've got a whole on the 2,050 wall started with a lot of quotes. Everything good was, once imagined and many other quotes are along those similar lines. And then rather than just being fearful of the things that I'm worried about for society and for humanity, I started to think, like, what would the alternative be? What is that vision that I would love to see us have? Basic human needs for all. Yeah. You know, global education being a basic human right that everyone experiences. All the really important things that we want as humanity. And again, like using vision and using imagination and just dreaming about the future. And I find it really fascinating in my day to day by literally having it beside me as I work every day. The little tiny decisions that can kind of help to angle towards that future that we want. And can I help will any of that into existence? I honestly don't know. But I feel like just by starting to write it down, I did some little brainstorm exercise with a number of other people and starting to just, like, etch out, like, how do we get closer and closer to that? You know, on my vision of the future, it's community. It's the whole of humanity trying to dream bigger and just to dream bigger goals and then us actually rising to that occasion in the world we don't want. I think loneliness is rife. Purpose is gone. What we teach people in schools is pointless. And in my vision for 2050, it's none of those things. Communities are bountiful. We all have deep purpose and that deep purpose springs from having bigger dreams that we collectively go out and achieve. With something that we're doing, at our Canva World to a keynote in two weeks' time, which I think is gonna be after this is released, we've been asking people what is one goal you'd like to see the world achieved in our lifetime. And then people literally writing it down, I think is pretty powerful. And then people sharing that with other people, I think is pretty powerful. And then us actually figuring out how the hell do we turn that reality that we all deeply desperately want into existence, I think it's genuinely one of the biggest questions about time. But then again, rather than trying to tackle that entire thing by yourself, how do you take that first tiny step that starts to see that in your own life, in your own family, in your own community? And I think that's where we'll get purpose from. And that's you know, I think that is one of the key answers to loneliness is actually working towards something bigger than yourself. Wow. I really appreciate you sharing all that. I was thinking as you're talking, just considering how wildly successful Canva has been and just how ambitious that was when you started, I would not be at all surprised that, this actually happens and that you achieve this very difficult vision. It's not something that I alone can achieve. Mhmm. I think we it it has to be, obviously, a global collective effort because there's zero chance I can go and achieve basic human needs for all. But I think that I'd like to change that I'd like to help change the mood. I'd like to help change the the way we're thinking about things. I I genuinely think there's a little we need to move course a little and decide not what what are all the things that we're kind of like, you know, what what's the freight train we're currently on, but what is it that we actually want? What do we want our societies to look like? What do we want the world to look like? Is it good enough that there's people, hundreds of millions of people that can't eat? Like, what the hell? Like, it just literally makes no sense. A column b world, you might say. Absolutely. Melanie, this was incredible. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you wanted to share? Anything else you wanna lead listeners with? Oh, you've been extremely extensive. I don't think I've got anything else to add, frankly. That's the goal. That's the goal. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Melania, are you ready? Let's go. First question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people? One of the books I love is The Power of Moments, and it talks am I supposed to be really fast and not tell you about it? It's it's all good. Okay. Two two books. The Power of Moments and, one of the books early on, I read was Designing the Obvious, which I found very insightful. Okay. I like to shift it to fast mode. You don't have to go super fast. All good. What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love? Not Canva. I love the Calm app. It is my daily companion. I use it to meditate. I, you know, use it to listen to music. I just find it very calming. Okay. First question. I usually ask about movies and TV shows. I hear you don't watch a lot because you're so busy and have so much going on. So I'm gonna try a new question Okay. You haven't asked before. I'm curious where this goes. So excluding Canva, what's a product you'd love to work on someday? Whether it's, like, an existing other company, like, oh, I wish I could work on that thing, or just a new product you'd love to build maybe after the Canva chapter? I feel like my Canva chapter is gonna go on for a long time. So I don't know that this because you've got to be on the side. Had two set plans that we're pretty pretty extensive. Maybe a company you'd love to fund. There we go. I feel like there's a lot of opportunity to create, global infrastructure that is truly empowering. And so as I look at my twenty fifty wall, I think there's a lot of things that are currently only exclusively available to a small number of people that should be available to everyone. And so the more that we can do to uplift, you know, the rising tide lifts or boats, I think, is a thing that's just so of such critical importance. And I think there is this weird belief that you can be fine and everyone else can be not fine and that's all cool. I don't think that's cool. I think everyone suffers in such a case. So I think more things that help everyone to rise. Maybe along those lines, but maybe not. Is there a life motto that you find yourself coming back to and work your own life? There's a few. I love the quote, happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony. I feel like that's a a constant aspiration. And then I've I've just been so obsessed lately with the idea that everything is led by imagination. That imagination is the very first step of that creative process. So everything is good because once imagined is a quote you're gonna be seeing from Canva all the time now, because it it's it is true that if you don't imagine it, you can't will it into existence. And in fact, everything great that we experience in life was first imagined. Wow. There's so much power to that. One, thought nugget there is just there's always tools now that can make thing make building so much easier. You can just build anything you want. Just describe it. But so many people are just like, I'm in the same boat. I'm just stuck. What do what do I want? I don't even like, I don't know what I mean. What should I build? And that's exactly what you're talking about there. Okay. Last question. So I saw it somewhere that you were a aspiring figure skater in your early years in high school. You had to wake up at 04:30AM to practice. Is there something you learned from that period of your life that was helpful in building Canva? Oh, so many things are quite directly applicable. Falling down over and over again and getting off and trying again, the importance of hard work and determination. I think the falling down, like, it was quite literal in in my figure skating in in days, and maybe it's a little more metaphorical in in today. But it it is constant. Until you're right. Yeah. I wonder what that metaphor is for figure skating. I don't know. Anyway, Melanie, this was incredible. I am so thankful that you agreed to do this. Two final questions. Or can folks find you if they wanna maybe reach out, send you maybe feedback on Canvas or join Canva? And how can listeners be useful to you? Really great questions. So you can find me on LinkedIn. That's where I post the most. And you can go to and I can get the URL to give us your wishes, and we want to hear them, and we literally listen to them. It doesn't just go into a suggestion box. And then how can they be helpful? Use Canva, spread Canva, teach Canva. We're doing a Canva world tour in through October, which is probably gonna be outdated, and this is posted. Come to our events. We do events all around the world, and we'd love to see you and to hear from you. And if you are in a company, starting a company, try and do the 1% pledge. Try and figure out your own version of the two step plan, and try and build products. And in every decision that you make that actually makes the world that you want to live in. I think there's this kind of belief sometimes that the world is created by other people, but we all have a very active hand in creating the world that we live in. And, you know, every decision that you make, every for investors, every company that you fund, is that contributing the world to the world that you want to live in? Or is it creating the freight train that none of us wanna be on? I have to ask before I let you go, this, are you gonna have the rap dancers at the the next Canva event? You'll have to wait and see. Okay. Melanie, thank you so much for being here. Thank you so much, Lenny, for having me. And your great, well researched questions. Thank you. Bye, everyone. Thank you so much for listening.
